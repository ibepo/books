## CHAPTER ONE -THE BOY WHO LIVED


Mr. and Mrs. Durs­ley, of num­ber four, Priv­et Drive, were proud to say that they were per­fect­ly nor­mal, thank you very much. They were the last peo­ple you’d ex­pect to be in­volved in any­thing strange or mys­te­ri­ous, be­cause they just didn’t hold with such non­sense.00

Mr. Durs­ley was the di­rec­tor of a firm called Grun­nings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hard­ly any neck, al­though he did have a very large mus­tache. Mrs. Durs­ley was thin and blonde and had near­ly twice the usu­al amount of neck, which came in very use­ful as she spent so much of her time cran­ing over gar­den fences, spy­ing on the neigh­bors. The Durs­leys had a small son called Dud­ley and in their opin­ion there was no fin­er boy any­where.

The Durs­leys had ev­ery­thing they want­ed, but they al­so had a se­cret, and their great­est fear was that some­body would dis­cov­er it. They didn’t think they could bear it if any­one found out about the Pot­ters. Mrs. Pot­ter was Mrs. Durs­ley’s sis­ter, but they hadn’t met for sev­er­al years; in fact, Mrs. Durs­ley pre­tend­ed she didn’t have a sis­ter, be­cause her sis­ter and her good-​for-​noth­ing hus­band were as un­Durs­ley­ish as it was pos­si­ble to be. The Durs­leys shud­dered to think what the neigh­bors would say if the Pot­ters ar­rived in the street. The Durs­leys knew that the Pot­ters had a small son, too, but they had nev­er even seen him. This boy was an­oth­er good rea­son for keep­ing the Pot­ters away; they didn’t want Dud­ley mix­ing with a child like that.

When Mr. and Mrs. Durs­ley woke up on the dull, gray Tues­day our sto­ry starts, there was noth­ing about the cloudy sky out­side to sug­gest that strange and mys­te­ri­ous things would soon be hap­pen­ing all over the coun­try. Mr. Durs­ley hummed as he picked out his most bor­ing tie for work, and Mrs. Durs­ley gos­siped away hap­pi­ly as she wres­tled a scream­ing Dud­ley in­to his high chair.

None of them no­ticed a large, tawny owl flut­ter past the win­dow.

At half past eight, Mr. Durs­ley picked up his brief­case, pecked Mrs. Durs­ley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dud­ley good-​bye but missed, be­cause Dud­ley was now hav­ing a tantrum and throw­ing his ce­re­al at the walls.

“Lit­tle tyke,” chor­tled Mr. Durs­ley as he left the house. He got in­to his car and backed out of num­ber four’s drive.

It was on the cor­ner of the street that he no­ticed the first sign of some­thing pe­cu­liar — a cat read­ing a map. For a sec­ond, Mr. Durs­ley didn’t re­al­ize what he had seen — then he jerked his head around to look again. There was a tab­by cat stand­ing on the cor­ner of Priv­et Drive, but there wasn’t a map in sight. What could he have been think­ing of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Durs­ley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Durs­ley drove around the cor­ner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mir­ror. It was now read­ing the sign that said Priv­et Drive — no, look­ing at the sign; cats couldn’t read maps or signs. Mr. Durs­ley gave him­self a lit­tle shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove to­ward town he thought of noth­ing ex­cept a large or­der of drills he was hop­ing to get that day.

But on the edge of town, drills were driv­en out of his mind by some­thing else. As he sat in the usu­al morn­ing traf­fic jam, he couldn’t help notic­ing that there seemed to be a lot of strange­ly dressed peo­ple about. Peo­ple in cloaks. Mr. Durs­ley couldn’t bear peo­ple who dressed in fun­ny clothes — the getups you saw on young peo­ple! He sup­posed this was some stupid new fash­ion. He drummed his fin­gers on the steer­ing wheel and his eyes fell on a hud­dle of these weirdos stand­ing quite close by. They were whis­per­ing ex­cit­ed­ly to­geth­er. Mr. Durs­ley was en­raged to see that a cou­ple of them weren’t young at all; why, that man had to be old­er than he was, and wear­ing an emer­ald-​green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Durs­ley that this was prob­ably some sil­ly stunt —these peo­ple were ob­vi­ous­ly col­lect­ing for some­thing…yes, that would be it. The traf­fic moved on and a few min­utes lat­er, Mr. Durs­ley ar­rived in the Grun­nings park­ing lot, his mind back on drills.

Mr. Durs­ley al­ways sat with his back to the win­dow in his of­fice on the ninth floor. If he hadn’t, he might have found it hard­er to con­cen­trate on drills that morn­ing. He didn’t see the owls swoop­ing past in broad day­light, though peo­ple down in the street did; they point­ed and gazed open-​mouthed as owl af­ter owl sped over­head. Most of them had nev­er seen an owl even at night­time. Mr. Durs­ley, how­ev­er, had a per­fect­ly nor­mal, owl-​free morn­ing. He yelled at five dif­fer­ent peo­ple. He made sev­er­al im­por­tant tele­phone calls and shout­ed a bit more. He was in a very good mood un­til lunchtime, when he thought he’d stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy him­self a bun from the bak­ery.

He’d for got­ten all about the peo­ple in cloaks un­til he passed a group of them next to the bak­er’s. He eyed them an­gri­ly as he passed. He didn’t know why, but they made him un­easy. This bunch were whis­per­ing ex­cit­ed­ly, too, and he couldn’t see a sin­gle col­lect­ing tin. It was on his way back past them, clutch­ing a large dough­nut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were say­ing.

“The Pot­ters, that’s right, that’s what I heard —”

“ — yes, their son, Har­ry —”

Mr. Durs­ley stopped dead. Fear flood­ed him. He looked back at the whis­per­ers as if he want­ed to say some­thing to them, but thought bet­ter of it.

He dashed back across the road, hur­ried up to his of­fice, snapped at his sec­re­tary not to dis­turb him, seized his tele­phone, and had al­most fin­ished di­al­ing his home num­ber when he changed his mind. He put the re­ceiv­er back down and stroked his mus­tache, think­ing…no, he was be­ing stupid. Pot­ter wasn’t such an un­usu­al name. He was sure there were lots of peo­ple called Pot­ter who had a son called Har­ry. Come to think of it, he wasn’t even sure his nephew was called Har­ry. He’d nev­er even seen the boy. It might have been Har­vey. Or Harold. There was no point in wor­ry­ing Mrs. Durs­ley; she al­ways got so up­set at any men­tion of her sis­ter. He didn’t blame her — if he’d had a sis­ter like that…but all the same, those peo­ple in cloaks.…

He found it a lot hard­er to con­cen­trate on drills that af­ter­noon and when he left the build­ing at five o’clock, he was still so wor­ried that he walked straight in­to some­one just out­side the door.

“Sor­ry,” he grunt­ed, as the tiny old man stum­bled and al­most fell. It was a few sec­onds be­fore Mr. Durs­ley re­al­ized that the man was wear­ing a vi­olet cloak. He didn’t seem at all up­set at be­ing al­most knocked to the ground. On the con­trary, his face split in­to a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passers­by stare, “Don’t be sor­ry, my dear sir, for noth­ing could up­set me to­day! Re­joice, for You-​Know-​Who has gone at last! Even Mug­gles like your­self should be cel­ebrat­ing, this hap­py, hap­py day!”

And the old man hugged Mr. Durs­ley around the mid­dle and walked off.

Mr. Durs­ley stood root­ed to the spot. He had been hugged by a com­plete stranger. He al­so thought he had been called a Mug­gle, what­ev­er that was. He was rat­tled. He hur­ried to his car and set off for home, hop­ing he was imag­in­ing things, which he had nev­er hoped be­fore, be­cause he didn’t ap­prove of imag­ina­tion.

As he pulled in­to the drive­way of num­ber four, the first thing he saw — and it didn’t im­prove his mood — was the tab­by cat he’d spot­ted that morn­ing. It was now sit­ting on his gar­den wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the same mark­ings around its eyes.

“Shoo!” said Mr. Durs­ley loud­ly.

The cat didn’t move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this nor­mal cat be­hav­ior? Mr. Durs­ley won­dered. Try­ing to pull him­self to­geth­er, he let him­self in­to the house. He was still de­ter­mined not to men­tion any­thing to his wife.

Mrs. Durs­ley had had a nice, nor­mal day. She told him over din­ner all about Mrs. Next Door’s prob­lems with her daugh­ter and how Dud­ley had learned a new word (“Won’t!”). Mr. Durs­ley tried to act nor­mal­ly. When Dud­ley had been put to bed, he went in­to the liv­ing room in time to catch the last re­port on the evening news:

“And fi­nal­ly, bird-​watch­ers ev­ery­where have re­port­ed that the na­tion’s owls have been be­hav­ing very un­usu­al­ly to­day. Al­though owls nor­mal­ly hunt at night and are hard­ly ev­er seen in day­light, there have been hun­dreds of sight­ings of these birds fly­ing in ev­ery di­rec­tion since sun­rise. Ex­perts are un­able to ex­plain why the owls have sud­den­ly changed their sleep­ing pat­tern.” The news­cast­er al­lowed him­self a grin. “Most mys­te­ri­ous. And now, over to Jim McGuf­fin with the weath­er. Go­ing to be any more show­ers of owls tonight, Jim?”

“Well, Ted,” said the weath­er­man, “I don’t know about that, but it’s not on­ly the owls that have been act­ing odd­ly to­day. View­ers as far apart as Kent, York­shire, and Dundee have been phon­ing in to tell me that in­stead of the rain I promised yes­ter­day, they’ve had a down­pour of shoot­ing stars! Per­haps peo­ple have been cel­ebrat­ing Bon­fire Night ear­ly — it’s not un­til next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight.”

Mr. Durs­ley sat frozen in his arm­chair. Shoot­ing stars all over Britain? Owls fly­ing by day­light? Mys­te­ri­ous peo­ple in cloaks all over the place? And a whis­per, a whis­per about the Pot­ters.…

Mrs. Durs­ley came in­to the liv­ing room car­ry­ing two cups of tea. It was no good. He’d have to say some­thing to her. He cleared his throat ner­vous­ly. “Er — Petu­nia, dear — you haven’t heard from your sis­ter late­ly, have you?”

As he had ex­pect­ed, Mrs. Durs­ley looked shocked and an­gry. Af­ter all, they nor­mal­ly pre­tend­ed she didn’t have a sis­ter.

“No,” she said sharply. “Why?”

“Fun­ny stuff on the news,” Mr. Durs­ley mum­bled. “Owls…shoot­ing stars…and there were a lot of fun­ny-​look­ing peo­ple in town to­day.…”

“So?” snapped Mrs. Durs­ley.

“Well, I just thought…maybe…it was some­thing to do with…you know…her crowd.”

Mrs. Durs­ley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Durs­ley won­dered whether he dared tell her he’d heard the name “Pot­ter.” He de­cid­ed he didn’t dare. In­stead he said, as ca­su­al­ly as he could, “Their son — he’d be about Dud­ley’s age now, wouldn’t he?”

“I sup­pose so,” said Mrs. Durs­ley stiffly.

“What’s his name again? Howard, isn’t it?”

“Har­ry. Nasty, com­mon name, if you ask me.”

“Oh, yes,” said Mr. Durs­ley, his heart sink­ing hor­ri­bly. “Yes, I quite agree.”

He didn’t say an­oth­er word on the sub­ject as they went up­stairs to bed. While Mrs. Durs­ley was in the bath­room, Mr. Durs­ley crept to the bed­room win­dow and peered down in­to the front gar­den. The cat was still there. It was star­ing down Priv­et Drive as though it were wait­ing for some­thing.

Was he imag­in­ing things? Could all this have any­thing to do with the Pot­ters? If it did...if it got out that they were re­lat­ed to a pair of — well, he didn’t think he could bear it.

The Durs­leys got in­to bed. Mrs. Durs­ley fell asleep quick­ly but Mr. Durs­ley lay awake, turn­ing it all over in his mind. His last, com­fort­ing thought be­fore he fell asleep was that even if the Pot­ters were in­volved, there was no rea­son for them to come near him and Mrs. Durs­ley. The Pot­ters knew very well what he and Petu­nia thought about them and their kind....He couldn’t see how he and Petu­nia could get mixed up in any­thing that might be go­ing on — he yawned and turned over — it couldn’t af­fect them.…

How very wrong he was.

Mr. Durs­ley might have been drift­ing in­to an un­easy sleep, but the cat on the wall out­side was show­ing no sign of sleepi­ness. It was sit­ting as still as a stat­ue, its eyes fixed un­blink­ing­ly on the far cor­ner of Priv­et Drive. It didn’t so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls swooped over­head. In fact, it was near­ly mid­night be­fore the cat moved at all.

A man ap­peared on the cor­ner the cat had been watch­ing, ap­peared so sud­den­ly and silent­ly you’d have thought he’d just popped out of the ground. The cat’s tail twitched and its eyes nar­rowed.

Noth­ing like this man had ev­er been seen on Priv­et Drive. He was tall, thin, and very old, judg­ing by the sil­ver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck in­to his belt. He was wear­ing long robes, a pur­ple cloak that swept the ground, and high-​heeled, buck­led boots. His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling be­hind half-​moon spec­ta­cles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been bro­ken at least twice. This man’s name was Al­bus Dum­ble­dore.

Al­bus Dum­ble­dore didn’t seem to re­al­ize that he had just ar­rived in a street where ev­ery­thing from his name to his boots was un­wel­come. He was busy rum­mag­ing in his cloak, look­ing for some­thing. But he did seem to re­al­ize he was be­ing watched, be­cause he looked up sud­den­ly at the cat, which was still star­ing at him from the oth­er end of the street. For some rea­son, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuck­led and mut­tered, “I should have known.”

He found what he was look­ing for in his in­side pock­et. It seemed to be a sil­ver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. The near­est street lamp went out with a lit­tle pop. He clicked it again — the next lamp flick­ered in­to dark­ness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-​Out­er, un­til the on­ly lights left on the whole street were two tiny pin­pricks in the dis­tance, which were the eyes of the cat watch­ing him. If any­one looked out of their win­dow now, even beady-​eyed Mrs. Durs­ley, they wouldn’t be able to see any­thing that was hap­pen­ing down on the pave­ment. Dum­ble­dore slipped the Put-​Out­er back in­side his cloak and set off down the street to­ward num­ber four, where he sat down on the wall next to the cat. He didn’t look at it, but af­ter a mo­ment he spoke to it.

“Fan­cy see­ing you here, Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall.”

He turned to smile at the tab­by, but it had gone. In­stead he was smil­ing at a rather se­vere-​look­ing wom­an who was wear­ing square glass­es ex­act­ly the shape of the mark­ings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wear­ing a cloak, an emer­ald one. Her black hair was drawn in­to a tight bun. She looked dis­tinct­ly ruf­fled.

“How did you know it was me?” she asked.

“My dear Pro­fes­sor, I’ve nev­er seen a cat sit so stiffly.”

“You’d be stiff if you’d been sit­ting on a brick wall all day,” said Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall.

“All day? When you could have been cel­ebrat­ing? I must have passed a dozen feasts and par­ties on my way here.”

Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall sniffed an­gri­ly.

“Oh yes, I’ve cel­ebrat­ing, all right,” she said im­pa­tient­ly. “You’d think they’d be a bit more care­ful, but no —even the Mug­gles have no­ticed some­thing’s go­ing on. It was on their news.” She jerked her head back at the Durs­leys’ dark liv­ing-​room win­dow. “I heard it. Flocks of owls…shoot­ing stars…Well, they’re not com­plete­ly stupid. They were bound to no­tice some­thing. Shoot­ing stars down in Kent — I’ll bet that was Dedalus Dig­gle. He nev­er had much sense.”

“You can’t blame them,” said Dum­ble­dore gen­tly. “We’ve had pre­cious lit­tle to cel­ebrate for eleven years.”

“I know that,” said Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall ir­ri­ta­bly. “But that’s no rea­son to lose our heads. Peo­ple are be­ing down­right care­less, out on the streets in broad day­light, not even dressed in Mug­gle clothes, swap­ping ru­mors.”

She threw a sharp, side­ways glance at Dum­ble­dore here, as though hop­ing he was go­ing to tell her some­thing, but he didn’t, so she went on. “A fine thing it would be if, on the very day You-​Know-​Who seems to have dis­ap­peared at last, the Mug­gles found out about us all. I sup­pose he re­al­ly has gone, Dum­ble­dore?”

“It cer­tain­ly seems so,” said Dum­ble­dore. “We have much to be thank­ful for. Would you care for a lemon drop?”

“A what?”

“A lemon drop. They’re a kind of Mug­gle sweet I’m rather fond of.”

“No, thank you,” said Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall cold­ly, as though she didn’t think this was the mo­ment for lemon drops. “As I say, even if You-​Know-​Who has gone —”

“My dear Pro­fes­sor, sure­ly a sen­si­ble per­son like your­self can call him by his name? All this ‘You-​Know-​Who’ non­sense — for eleven years I have been try­ing to per­suade peo­ple to call him by his prop­er name: Volde­mort.” Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall flinched, but Dum­ble­dore, who was un­stick­ing two lemon drops, seemed not to no­tice. “It all gets so con­fus­ing if we keep say­ing ‘You-​Know-​Who.’ I have nev­er seen any rea­son to be fright­ened of say­ing Volde­mort’s name.”

“I know you haven’t, said Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall, sound­ing half ex­as­per­at­ed, half ad­mir­ing. “But you’re dif­fer­ent. Ev­ery­one knows you’re the on­ly one You-​Know- oh, all right, Volde­mort, was fright­ened of.”

“You flat­ter me,” said Dum­ble­dore calm­ly. “Volde­mort had pow­ers I will nev­er have.”

“On­ly be­cause you’re too — well — no­ble to use them.”

“It’s lucky it’s dark. I haven’t blushed so much since Madam Pom­frey told me she liked my new ear­muffs.”

Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall shot a sharp look at Dum­ble­dore and said “The owls are noth­ing next to the ru­mors that are fly­ing around. You know what they’re say­ing? About why he’s dis­ap­peared? About what fi­nal­ly stopped him?”

It seemed that Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall had reached the point she was most anx­ious to dis­cuss, the re­al rea­son she had been wait­ing on a cold, hard wall all day, for nei­ther as a cat nor as a wom­an had she fixed Dum­ble­dore with such a pierc­ing stare as she did now. It was plain that what­ev­er “ev­ery­one” was say­ing, she was not go­ing to be­lieve it un­til Dum­ble­dore told her it was true. Dum­ble­dore, how­ev­er, was choos­ing an­oth­er lemon drop and did not an­swer.

“What they’re say­ing,” she pressed on, “is that last night Volde­mort turned up in Go­dric’s Hol­low. He went to find the Pot­ters. The ru­mor is that Lily and James Pot­ter are — are — that they’re — dead.”

Dum­ble­dore bowed his head. Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall gasped.

“Lily and James…I can’t be­lieve it…I didn’t want to be­lieve it…Oh, Al­bus…”

Dum­ble­dore reached out and pat­ted her on the shoul­der. “I know…I know…” he said heav­ily.

Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall’s voice trem­bled as she went on. “That’s not all. They’re say­ing he tried to kill the Pot­ter’s son, Har­ry. But he couldn’t. He couldn’t kill that lit­tle boy. No one knows why, or how, but they’re say­ing that when he couldn’t kill Har­ry Pot­ter, Volde­mort’s pow­er some­how broke — and that’s why he’s gone.”

Dum­ble­dore nod­ded glum­ly.

“It’s — it’s true?” fal­tered Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall. “Af­ter all he’s done…all the peo­ple he’s killed…he couldn’t kill a lit­tle boy? It’s just as­tound­ing…of all the things to stop him…but how in the name of heav­en did Har­ry sur­vive?”

“We can on­ly guess.” said Dum­ble­dore. “We may nev­er know.”

Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall pulled out a lace hand­ker­chief and dabbed at her eyes be­neath her spec­ta­cles. Dum­ble­dore gave a great sniff as he took a gold­en watch from his pock­et and ex­am­ined it. It was a very odd watch. It had twelve hands but no num­bers; in­stead, lit­tle plan­ets were mov­ing around the edge. It must have made sense to Dum­ble­dore, though, be­cause he put it back in his pock­et and said, “Ha­grid’s late. I sup­pose it was he who told you I’d be here, by the way?”

“Yes,” said Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall. “And I don’t sup­pose you’re go­ing to tell me why you’re here, of all places?”

“I’ve come to bring Har­ry to his aunt and un­cle. They’re the on­ly fam­ily he has left now.”

“You don’t mean – you can’t mean the peo­ple who live here?” cried Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall, jump­ing to her feet and point­ing at num­ber four. “Dum­ble­dore — you can’t. I’ve been watch­ing them all day. You couldn’t find two peo­ple who are less like us. And they’ve got this son — I saw him kick­ing his moth­er all the way up the street, scream­ing for sweets. Har­ry Pot­ter come and live here!”

“It’s the best place for him,” said Dum­ble­dore firm­ly. “His aunt and un­cle will be able to ex­plain ev­ery­thing to him when he’s old­er. I’ve writ­ten them a let­ter.”

“A let­ter?” re­peat­ed Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall faint­ly, sit­ting back down on the wall. “Re­al­ly, Dum­ble­dore, you think you can ex­plain all this in a let­ter? These peo­ple will nev­er un­der­stand him! He’ll be fa­mous — a leg­end — I wouldn’t be sur­prised if to­day was known as Har­ry Pot­ter day in the fu­ture — there will be books writ­ten about Har­ry — ev­ery child in our world will know his name!”

“Ex­act­ly.” said Dum­ble­dore, look­ing very se­ri­ous­ly over the top of his half-​moon glass­es. “It would be enough to turn any boy’s head. Fa­mous be­fore he can walk and talk! Fa­mous for some­thing he won’t even re­mem­ber! Can you see how much bet­ter off he’ll be, grow­ing up away from all that un­til he’s ready to take it?”

Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swal­lowed, and then said, “Yes — yes, you’re right, of course. But how is the boy get­ting here, Dum­ble­dore?” She eyed his cloak sud­den­ly as though she thought he might be hid­ing Har­ry un­der­neath it.

“Ha­grid’s bring­ing him.”

“You think it — wise — to trust Ha­grid with some­thing as im­por­tant as this?”

“I would trust Ha­grid with my life,” said Dum­ble­dore.

“I’m not say­ing his heart isn’t in the right place,” said Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall grudg­ing­ly, “but you can’t pre­tend he’s not care­less. He does tend to — what was that?”

A low rum­bling sound had bro­ken the si­lence around them. It grew steadi­ly loud­er as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a head­light; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky — and a huge mo­tor­cy­cle fell out of the air and land­ed on the road in front of them.

If the mo­tor­cy­cle was huge, it was noth­ing to the man sit­ting astride it. He was al­most twice as tall as a nor­mal man and at least five times as wide. He looked sim­ply too big to be al­lowed, and so wild — long tan­gles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were like ba­by dol­phins. In his vast, mus­cu­lar arms he was hold­ing a bun­dle of blan­kets.

“Ha­grid,” said Dum­ble­dore, sound­ing re­lieved. “At last. And where did you get that mo­tor­cy­cle?”

“Bor­rowed it, Pro­fes­sor Dum­ble­dore, sir,” said the gi­ant, climb­ing care­ful­ly off the mo­tor­cy­cle as he spoke. “Young Sir­ius Black lent it to me. I’ve got him, sir.”

“No prob­lems, were there?”

“No, sir — house was al­most de­stroyed, but I got him out all right be­fore the Mug­gles start­ed swarmin’ around. He fell asleep as we was fly­in’ over Bris­tol.”

Dum­ble­dore and Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall bent for­ward over the bun­dle of blan­kets. In­side, just vis­ible, was a ba­by boy, fast asleep. Un­der a tuft of jet-​black hair over his fore­head they could see a cu­ri­ous­ly shaped cut, like a bolt of light­ning.

“Is that where —?” whis­pered Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall.

“Yes,” said Dum­ble­dore. “He’ll have that scar for­ev­er.”

“Couldn’t you do some­thing about it, Dum­ble­dore?”

“Even if I could, I wouldn’t. Scars can come in handy. I have one my­self above my left knee that is a per­fect map of the Lon­don Un­der­ground. Well — give him here, Ha­grid — we’d bet­ter get this over with.”

Dum­ble­dore took Har­ry in his arms and turned to­ward the Durs­leys’ house.

“Could I — could I say good-​bye to him, sir?” asked Ha­grid. He bent his great, shag­gy head over Har­ry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, sud­den­ly, Ha­grid let out a howl like a wound­ed dog.

“Shhh!” hissed Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall, “You’ll wake the Mug­gles!”

“S-​s-​sor­ry,” sobbed Ha­grid, tak­ing out a large, spot­ted hand­ker­chief and bury­ing his face in it. “But I c-​c-​can’t stand it —Lily an’ James dead — an’ poor lit­tle Har­ry off ter live with Mug­gles —”

“Yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on your­self, Ha­grid, or we’ll be found,” Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall whis­pered, pat­ting Ha­grid gin­ger­ly on the arm as Dum­ble­dore stepped over the low gar­den wall and walked to the front door. He laid Har­ry gen­tly on the doorstep, took a let­ter out of his cloak, tucked it in­side Har­ry’s blan­kets, and then came back to the oth­er two. For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the lit­tle bun­dle; Ha­grid’s shoul­ders shook, Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall blinked fu­ri­ous­ly, and the twin­kling light that usu­al­ly shone from Dum­ble­dore’s eyes seemed to have gone out.

“Well,” said Dum­ble­dore fi­nal­ly, “that’s that. We’ve no busi­ness stay­ing here. We may as well go and join the cel­ebra­tions.”

“Yeah,” said Ha­grid in a very muf­fled voice, “I’ll be takin’ Sir­ius his bike back. G’night, Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall — Pro­fes­sor Dum­ble­dore, sir.”

Wip­ing his stream­ing eyes on his jack­et sleeve, Ha­grid swung him­self on­to the mo­tor­cy­cle and kicked the en­gine in­to life; with a roar it rose in­to the air and off in­to the night.

“I shall see you soon, I ex­pect, Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall,” said Dum­ble­dore, nod­ding to her. Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall blew her nose in re­ply.

Dum­ble­dore turned and walked back down the street. On the cor­ner he stopped and took out the sil­ver Put-​Out­er. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Priv­et Drive glowed sud­den­ly or­ange and he could make out a tab­by cat slink­ing around the cor­ner at the oth­er end of the street. He could just see the bun­dle of blan­kets on the step of num­ber four.

“Good luck, Har­ry,” he mur­mured. He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone.

A breeze ruf­fled the neat hedges of Priv­et Drive, which lay silent and tidy un­der the inky sky, the very last place you would ex­pect as­ton­ish­ing things to hap­pen. Har­ry Pot­ter rolled over in­side his blan­kets with­out wak­ing up. One small hand closed on the let­ter be­side him and he slept on, not know­ing he was spe­cial, not know­ing he was fa­mous, not know­ing he would be wo­ken in a few hours’ time by Mrs. Durs­ley’s scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bot­tles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks be­ing prod­ded and pinched by his cousin Dud­ley....He couldn’t know that at this very mo­ment, peo­ple meet­ing in se­cret all over the coun­try were hold­ing up their glass­es and say­ing in hushed voic­es: “To Har­ry Pot­ter — the boy who lived!”

CHAPTER TWO




THE VAN­ISH­ING GLASS



N ear­ly ten years had passed since the Durs­leys had wo­ken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Priv­et Drive had hard­ly changed at all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gar­dens and lit up the brass num­ber four on the Durs­leys’ front door; it crept in­to their liv­ing room, which was al­most ex­act­ly the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Durs­ley had seen that fate­ful news re­port about the owls. On­ly the pho­tographs on the man­tel­piece re­al­ly showed how much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pic­tures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wear­ing dif­fer­ent-​col­ored bon­nets — but Dud­ley Durs­ley was no longer a ba­by, and now the pho­tographs showed a large blond boy rid­ing his first bi­cy­cle, on a carousel at the fair, play­ing a com­put­er game with his fa­ther, be­ing hugged and kissed by his moth­er. The room held no sign at all that an­oth­er boy lived in the house, too.

Yet Har­ry Pot­ter was still there, asleep at the mo­ment, but not for long. His Aunt Petu­nia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day.

“Up! Get up! Now!”

Har­ry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again.

“Up!” she screeched. Har­ry heard her walk­ing to­ward the kitchen and then the sound of the fry­ing pan be­ing put on the stove. He rolled on­to his back and tried to re­mem­ber the dream he had been hav­ing. It had been a good one. There had been a fly­ing mo­tor­cy­cle in it. He had a fun­ny feel­ing he’d had the same dream be­fore.

His aunt was back out­side the door.

“Are you up yet?” she de­mand­ed.

“Near­ly,” said Har­ry.

“Well, get a move on, I want you to look af­ter the ba­con. And don’t you dare let it burn, I want ev­ery­thing per­fect on Dud­dy’s birth­day.”

Har­ry groaned.

“What did you say?” his aunt snapped through the door.

“Noth­ing, noth­ing…”

Dud­ley’s birth­day — how could he have for­got­ten? Har­ry got slow­ly out of bed and start­ed look­ing for socks. He found a pair un­der his bed and, af­ter pulling a spi­der off one of them, put them on. Har­ry was used to spi­ders, be­cause the cup­board un­der the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept.

When he was dressed he went down the hall in­to the kitchen. The ta­ble was al­most hid­den be­neath all Dud­ley’s birth­day presents. It looked as though Dud­ley had got­ten the new com­put­er he want­ed, not to men­tion the sec­ond tele­vi­sion and the rac­ing bike. Ex­act­ly why Dud­ley want­ed a rac­ing bike was a mys­tery to Har­ry, as Dud­ley was very fat and hat­ed ex­er­cise — un­less of course it in­volved punch­ing some­body. Dud­ley’s fa­vorite punch­ing bag was Har­ry, but he couldn’t of­ten catch him. Har­ry didn’t look it, but he was very fast.

Per­haps it had some­thing to do with liv­ing in a dark cup­board, but Har­ry had al­ways been small and skin­ny for his age. He looked even small­er and skin­nier than he re­al­ly was be­cause all he had to wear were old clothes of Dud­ley’s, and Dud­ley was about four times big­ger than he was. Har­ry had a thin face, knob­bly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glass­es held to­geth­er with a lot of Scotch tape be­cause of all the times Dud­ley had punched him on the nose. The on­ly thing Har­ry liked about his own ap­pear­ance was a very thin scar on his fore­head that was shaped like a bolt of light­ning. He had had it as long as he could re­mem­ber, and the first ques­tion he could ev­er re­mem­ber ask­ing his Aunt Petu­nia was how he had got­ten it.

“In the car crash when your par­ents died,” she had said. “And don’t ask ques­tions.”

Don’t ask ques­tions — that was the first rule for a qui­et life with the Durs­leys.

Un­cle Ver­non en­tered the kitchen as Har­ry was turn­ing over the ba­con.

“Comb your hair!” he barked, by way of a morn­ing greet­ing.

About once a week, Un­cle Ver­non looked over the top of his news­pa­per and shout­ed that Har­ry need­ed a hair­cut. Har­ry must have had more hair­cuts than the rest of the boys in his class put to­geth­er, but it made no dif­fer­ence, his hair sim­ply grew that way — all over the place.

Har­ry was fry­ing eggs by the time Dud­ley ar­rived in the kitchen with his moth­er. Dud­ley looked a lot like Un­cle Ver­non. He had a large pink face, not much neck, small, wa­tery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smooth­ly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petu­nia of­ten said that Dud­ley looked like a ba­by an­gel — Har­ry of­ten said that Dud­ley looked like a pig in a wig.

Har­ry put the plates of egg and ba­con on the ta­ble, which was dif­fi­cult as there wasn’t much room. Dud­ley, mean­while, was count­ing his presents. His face fell.

“Thir­ty-​six,” he said, look­ing up at his moth­er and fa­ther. “That’s two less than last year.”

“Dar­ling, you haven’t count­ed Aun­tie Marge’s present, see, it’s here un­der this big one from Mum­my and Dad­dy.”

“All right, thir­ty-​sev­en then,” said Dud­ley, go­ing red in the face. Har­ry, who could see a huge Dud­ley tantrum com­ing on, be­gan wolf­ing down his ba­con as fast as pos­si­ble in case Dud­ley turned the ta­ble over.

Aunt Petu­nia ob­vi­ous­ly scent­ed dan­ger, too, be­cause she said quick­ly, “And we’ll buy you an­oth­er two presents while we’re out to­day. How’s that, pop­kin? Two more presents. Is that all right”

Dud­ley thought for a mo­ment. It looked like hard work. Fi­nal­ly he said slow­ly, “So I’ll have thir­ty...thir­ty...”

“Thir­ty-​nine, swee­tums,” said Aunt Petu­nia.

“Oh.” Dud­ley sat down heav­ily and grabbed the near­est par­cel. “All right then.”

Un­cle Ver­non chuck­led.

“Lit­tle tyke wants his mon­ey’s worth, just like his fa­ther. ’At­ta boy, Dud­ley!” He ruf­fled Dud­ley’s hair.

At that mo­ment the tele­phone rang and Aunt Petu­nia went to an­swer it while Har­ry and Un­cle Ver­non watched Dud­ley un­wrap the rac­ing bike, a video cam­era, a re­mote con­trol air­plane, six­teen new com­put­er games, and a VCR. He was rip­ping the pa­per off a gold wrist­watch when Aunt Petu­nia came back from the tele­phone look­ing both an­gry and wor­ried.

“Bad news, Ver­non,” she said. “Mrs. Figg’s bro­ken her leg. She can’t take him.” She jerked her head in Har­ry’s di­rec­tion.

Dud­ley’s mouth fell open in hor­ror, but Har­ry’s heart gave a leap. Ev­ery year on Dud­ley’s birth­day, his par­ents took him and a friend out for the day, to ad­ven­ture parks, ham­burg­er restau­rants, or the movies. Ev­ery year, Har­ry was left be­hind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old la­dy who lived two streets away. Har­ry hat­ed it there. The whole house smelled of cab­bage and Mrs. Figg made him look at pho­tographs of all the cats she’d ev­er owned.

“Now what?” said Aunt Petu­nia, look­ing fu­ri­ous­ly at Har­ry as though he’d planned this. Har­ry knew he ought to feel sor­ry that Mrs. Figg had bro­ken her leg, but it wasn’t easy when he re­mind­ed him­self it would be a whole year be­fore he had to look at Tib­bles, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again.

“We could phone Marge,” Un­cle Ver­non sug­gest­ed.

“Don’t be sil­ly, Ver­non, she hates the boy.”

The Durs­leys of­ten spoke about Har­ry like this, as though he wasn’t there — or rather, as though he was some­thing very nasty that couldn’t un­der­stand them, like a slug.

“What about what’s-​her-​name, your friend — Yvonne?”

“On va­ca­tion in Ma­jor­ca,” snapped Aunt Petu­nia.

“You could just leave me here,” Har­ry put in hope­ful­ly (he’d be able to watch what he want­ed on tele­vi­sion for a change and maybe even have a go on Dud­ley’s com­put­er).

Aunt Petu­nia looked as though she’d just swal­lowed a lemon.

“And come back and find the house in ru­ins?” she snarled.

“I won’t blow up the house,” said Har­ry, but they weren’t lis­ten­ing.

“I sup­pose we could take him to the zoo,” said Aunt Petu­nia slow­ly, “…and leave him in the car.…”

“That car’s new, he’s not sit­ting in it alone.…”

Dud­ley be­gan to cry loud­ly. In fact, he wasn’t re­al­ly cry­ing — it had been years since he’d re­al­ly cried — but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed, his moth­er would give him any­thing he want­ed.

“Dinky Dud­dy­dums, don’t cry, Mum­my won’t let him spoil your spe­cial day!” she cried, fling­ing her arms around him.

“I…don’t…want…him…t-​t-​to come!” Dud­ley yelled be­tween huge, pre­tend sobs. “He al­ways sp-​spoils ev­ery­thing!” He shot Har­ry a nasty grin through the gap in his moth­er’s arms.

Just then, the door­bell rang — “Oh, good Lord, they’re here!” said Aunt Petu­nia fran­ti­cal­ly — and a mo­ment lat­er, Dud­ley’s best friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with his moth­er. Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat. He was usu­al­ly the one who held peo­ple’s arms be­hind their backs while Dud­ley hit them. Dud­ley stopped pre­tend­ing to cry at once.

Half an hour lat­er, Har­ry, who couldn’t be­lieve his luck, was sit­ting in the back of the Durs­leys’ car with Piers and Dud­ley, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life. His aunt and un­cle hadn’t been able to think of any­thing else to do with him, but be­fore they’d left, Un­cle Ver­non had tak­en Har­ry aside.

“I’m warn­ing you,” he had said, putting his large pur­ple face right up close to Har­ry’s, “I’m warn­ing you now, boy — any fun­ny busi­ness, any­thing at all — and you’ll be in that cup­board from now un­til Christ­mas.”

“I’m not go­ing to do any­thing,” said Har­ry, “hon­est­ly…”

But Un­cle Ver­non didn’t be­lieve him. No one ev­er did.

The prob­lem was, strange things of­ten hap­pened around Har­ry and it was just no good telling the Durs­leys he didn’t make them hap­pen.

Once, Aunt Petu­nia, tired of Har­ry com­ing back from the bar­bers look­ing as though he hadn’t been at all, had tak­en a pair of kitchen scis­sors and cut his hair so short he was al­most bald ex­cept for his bangs, which she left “to hide that hor­ri­ble scar.” Dud­ley had laughed him­self sil­ly at Har­ry, who spent a sleep­less night imag­in­ing school the next day, where he was al­ready laughed at for his bag­gy clothes and taped glass­es. Next morn­ing, how­ev­er, he had got­ten up to find his hair ex­act­ly as it had been be­fore Aunt Petu­nia had sheared it off He had been giv­en a week in his cup­board for this, even though he had tried to ex­plain that he couldn’t ex­plain how it had grown back so quick­ly.

An­oth­er time, Aunt Petu­nia had been try­ing to force him in­to a re­volt­ing old sweater of Dud­ley’s (brown with or­ange puff balls). The hard­er she tried to pull it over his head, the small­er it seemed to be­come, un­til fi­nal­ly it might have fit­ted a hand pup­pet, but cer­tain­ly wouldn’t fit Har­ry. Aunt Petu­nia had de­cid­ed it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great re­lief, Har­ry wasn’t pun­ished.

On the oth­er hand, he’d got­ten in­to ter­ri­ble trou­ble for be­ing found on the roof of the school kitchens. Dud­ley’s gang had been chas­ing him as usu­al when, as much to Har­ry’s sur­prise as any­one else’s, there he was sit­ting on the chim­ney. The Durs­leys had re­ceived a very an­gry let­ter from Har­ry’s head­mistress telling them Har­ry had been climb­ing school build­ings. But all he’d tried to do (as he shout­ed at Un­cle Ver­non through the locked door of his cup­board) was jump be­hind the big trash cans out­side the kitchen doors. Har­ry sup­posed that the wind must have caught him in mid-​jump.

But to­day, noth­ing was go­ing to go wrong. It was even worth be­ing with Dud­ley and Piers to be spend­ing the day some­where that wasn’t school, his cup­board, or Mrs. Figg’s cab­bage-​smelling liv­ing room.

While he drove, Un­cle Ver­non com­plained to Aunt Petu­nia. He liked to com­plain about things: peo­ple at work, Har­ry, the coun­cil, Har­ry, the bank, and Har­ry were just a few of his fa­vorite sub­jects. This morn­ing, it was mo­tor­cy­cles.

“…roar­ing along like ma­ni­acs, the young hood­lums,” he said, as a mo­tor­cy­cle over­took them.

“I had a dream about a mo­tor­cy­cle,” said Har­ry, re­mem­ber­ing sud­den­ly. “It was fly­ing.”

Un­cle Ver­non near­ly crashed in­to the car in front. He turned right around in his seat and yelled at Har­ry, his face like a gi­gan­tic beet with a mus­tache: “MO­TOR­CY­CLES DON’T FLY!”

Dud­ley and Piers snig­gered.

“I know they don’t,” said Har­ry. “It was on­ly a dream.”

But he wished he hadn’t said any­thing. If there was one thing the Durs­leys hat­ed even more than his ask­ing ques­tions, it was his talk­ing about any­thing act­ing in a way it shouldn’t, no mat­ter if it was in a dream or even a car­toon — they seemed to think he might get dan­ger­ous ideas.

It was a very sun­ny Sat­ur­day and the zoo was crowd­ed with fam­ilies. The Durs­leys bought Dud­ley and Piers large choco­late ice creams at the en­trance and then, be­cause the smil­ing la­dy in the van had asked Har­ry what he want­ed be­fore they could hur­ry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. It wasn’t bad, ei­ther, Har­ry thought, lick­ing it as they watched a go­ril­la scratch­ing its head who looked re­mark­ably like Dud­ley, ex­cept that it wasn’t blond.

Har­ry had the best morn­ing he’d had in a long time. He was care­ful to walk a lit­tle way apart from the Durs­leys so that Dud­ley and Piers, who were start­ing to get bored with the an­imals by lunchtime, wouldn’t fall back on their fa­vorite hob­by of hit­ting him. They ate in the zoo restau­rant, and when Dud­ley had a tantrum be­cause his knicker­bock­er glo­ry didn’t have enough ice cream on top, Un­cle Ver­non bought him an­oth­er one and Har­ry was al­lowed to fin­ish the first.

Har­ry felt, af­ter­ward, that he should have known it was all too good to last.

Af­ter lunch they went to the rep­tile house. It was cool and dark in there, with lit win­dows all along the walls. Be­hind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawl­ing and slith­er­ing over bits of wood and stone. Dud­ley and Piers want­ed to see huge, poi­sonous co­bras and thick, man-​crush­ing pythons. Dud­ley quick­ly found the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Un­cle Ver­non’s car and crushed it in­to a trash can — but at the mo­ment it didn’t look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep.

Dud­ley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, star­ing at the glis­ten­ing brown coils.

“Make it move,” he whined at his fa­ther. Un­cle Ver­non tapped on the glass, but the snake didn’t budge.

“Do it again,” Dud­ley or­dered. Un­cle Ver­non rapped the glass smart­ly with his knuck­les, but the snake just snoozed on.

“This is bor­ing,” Dud­ley moaned. He shuf­fled away.

Har­ry moved in front of the tank and looked in­tent­ly at the snake. He wouldn’t have been sur­prised if it had died of bore­dom it­self — no com­pa­ny ex­cept stupid peo­ple drum­ming their fin­gers on the glass try­ing to dis­turb it all day long. It was worse than hav­ing a cup­board as a bed­room, where the on­ly vis­itor was Aunt Petu­nia ham­mer­ing on the door to wake you up; at least he got to vis­it the rest of the house.

The snake sud­den­ly opened its beady eyes. Slow­ly, very slow­ly, it raised its head un­til its eyes were on a lev­el with Har­ry’s.

It winked.

Har­ry stared. Then he looked quick­ly around to see if any­one was watch­ing. They weren’t. He looked back at the snake and winked, too.

The snake jerked its head to­ward Un­cle Ver­non and Dud­ley, then raised its eyes to the ceil­ing. It gave Har­ry a look that said quite plain­ly:

“I get that all the time.”

“I know,” Har­ry mur­mured through the glass, though he wasn’t sure the snake could hear him. “It must be re­al­ly an­noy­ing.”

The snake nod­ded vig­or­ous­ly.

“Where do you come from, any­way?” Har­ry asked.

The snake jabbed its tail at a lit­tle sign next to the glass. Har­ry peered at it.

Boa Con­stric­tor, Brazil.

“Was it nice there?”

The boa con­stric­tor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Har­ry read on: This spec­imen was bred in the zoo. “Oh, I see — so you’ve nev­er been to Brazil?”

As the snake shook its head, a deaf­en­ing shout be­hind Har­ry made both of them jump. “DUD­LEY! MR. DURS­LEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU WON’T BE­LIEVE WHAT IT’S DO­ING!”

Dud­ley came wad­dling to­ward them as fast as he could.

“Out of the way, you,” he said, punch­ing Har­ry in the ribs. Caught by sur­prise, Har­ry fell hard on the con­crete floor. What came next hap­pened so fast no one saw how it hap­pened — one sec­ond, Piers and Dud­ley were lean­ing right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of hor­ror.

Har­ry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa con­stric­tor’s tank had van­ished. The great snake was un­coil­ing it­self rapid­ly, slith­er­ing out on­to the floor. Peo­ple through­out the rep­tile house screamed and start­ed run­ning for the ex­its.

As the snake slid swift­ly past him, Har­ry could have sworn a low, hiss­ing voice said, “Brazil, here I come.… Thanksss, ami­go.”

The keep­er of the rep­tile house was in shock.

“But the glass,” he kept say­ing, “where did the glass go?”

The zoo di­rec­tor him­self made Aunt Petu­nia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apol­ogized over and over again. Piers and Dud­ley could on­ly gib­ber. As far as Har­ry had seen, the snake hadn’t done any­thing ex­cept snap play­ful­ly at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Un­cle Ver­non’s car, Dud­ley was telling them how it had near­ly bit­ten off his leg, while Piers was swear­ing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Har­ry at least, was Piers calm­ing down enough to say, “Har­ry was talk­ing to it, weren’t you, Har­ry?”

Un­cle Ver­non wait­ed un­til Piers was safe­ly out of the house be­fore start­ing on Har­ry. He was so an­gry he could hard­ly speak. He man­aged to say, “Go — cup­board — stay — no meals,” be­fore he col­lapsed in­to a chair, and Aunt Petu­nia had to run and get him a large brandy.



Har­ry lay in his dark cup­board much lat­er, wish­ing he had a watch. He didn’t know what time it was and he couldn’t be sure the Durs­leys were asleep yet. Un­til they were, he couldn’t risk sneak­ing to the kitchen for some food.

He’d lived with the Durs­leys al­most ten years, ten mis­er­able years, as long as he could re­mem­ber, ev­er since he’d been a ba­by and his par­ents had died in that car crash. He couldn’t re­mem­ber be­ing in the car when his par­ents had died. Some­times, when he strained his mem­ory dur­ing long hours in his cup­board, he came up with a strange vi­sion: a blind­ing flash of green light and a burn­ing pain on his fore­head. This, he sup­posed, was the crash, though he couldn’t imag­ine where all the green light came from. He couldn’t re­mem­ber his par­ents at all. His aunt and un­cle nev­er spoke about them, and of course he was for­bid­den to ask ques­tions. There were no pho­tographs of them in the house.

When he had been younger, Har­ry had dreamed and dreamed of some un­known re­la­tion com­ing to take him away, but it had nev­er hap­pened; the Durs­leys were his on­ly fam­ily. Yet some­times he thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangers they were, too. A tiny man in a vi­olet top hat had bowed to him once while out shop­ping with Aunt Petu­nia and Dud­ley. Af­ter ask­ing Har­ry fu­ri­ous­ly if he knew the man, Aunt Petu­nia had rushed them out of the shop with­out buy­ing any­thing. A wild-​look­ing old wom­an dressed all in green had waved mer­ri­ly at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very long pur­ple coat had ac­tu­al­ly shak­en his hand in the street the oth­er day and then walked away with­out a word. The weird­est thing about all these peo­ple was the way they seemed to van­ish the sec­ond Har­ry tried to get a clos­er look.

At school, Har­ry had no one. Ev­ery­body knew that Dud­ley’s gang hat­ed that odd Har­ry Pot­ter in his bag­gy old clothes and bro­ken glass­es, and no­body liked to dis­agree with Dud­ley’s gang.

CHAPTER THREE




LET­TERS FROM NO ONE



T he es­cape of the Brazil­ian boa con­stric­tor earned Har­ry his longest-​ev­er pun­ish­ment. By the time he was al­lowed out of his cup­board again, the sum­mer hol­idays had start­ed and Dud­ley had al­ready bro­ken his new video cam­era, crashed his re­mote con­trol air­plane, and, first time out on his rac­ing bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Priv­et Drive on her crutch­es.

Har­ry was glad school was over, but there was no es­cap­ing Dud­ley’s gang, who vis­it­ed the house ev­ery sin­gle day. Piers, Den­nis, Mal­colm, and Gor­don were all big and stupid, but as Dud­ley was the biggest and stupi­dest of the lot, he was the lead­er. The rest of them were all quite hap­py to join in Dud­ley’s fa­vorite sport: Har­ry Hunt­ing.

This was why Har­ry spent as much time as pos­si­ble out of the house, wan­der­ing around and think­ing about the end of the hol­idays, where he could see a tiny ray of hope. When Septem­ber came he would be go­ing off to sec­ondary school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn’t be with Dud­ley. Dud­ley had been ac­cept­ed at Un­cle Ver­non’s old pri­vate school, Smelt­ings. Piers Polkiss was go­ing there too. Har­ry, on the oth­er hand, was go­ing to Stonewall High, the lo­cal pub­lic school. Dud­ley thought this was very fun­ny.

“They stuff peo­ple’s heads down the toi­let the first day at Stonewall,” he told Har­ry. “Want to come up­stairs and prac­tice?”

“No, thanks,” said Har­ry. “The poor toi­let’s nev­er had any­thing as hor­ri­ble as your head down it — it might be sick.” Then he ran, be­fore Dud­ley could work out what he’d said.

One day in Ju­ly, Aunt Petu­nia took Dud­ley to Lon­don to buy his Smelt­ings uni­form, leav­ing Har­ry at Mrs. Figg’s. Mrs. Figg wasn’t as bad as usu­al. It turned out she’d bro­ken her leg trip­ping over one of her cats, and she didn’t seem quite as fond of them as be­fore. She let Har­ry watch tele­vi­sion and gave him a bit of choco­late cake that tast­ed as though she’d had it for sev­er­al years.

That evening, Dud­ley pa­rad­ed around the liv­ing room for the fam­ily in his brand-​new uni­form. Smelt­ings’ boys wore ma­roon tail­coats, or­ange knicker­bock­ers, and flat straw hats called boaters. They al­so car­ried knob­bly sticks, used for hit­ting each oth­er while the teach­ers weren’t look­ing. This was sup­posed to be good train­ing for lat­er life.

As he looked at Dud­ley in his new knicker­bock­ers, Un­cle Ver­non said gruffly that it was the proud­est mo­ment of his life. Aunt Petu­nia burst in­to tears and said she couldn’t be­lieve it was her Ick­le Dud­leykins, he looked so hand­some and grown-​up. Har­ry didn’t trust him­self to speak. He thought two of his ribs might al­ready have cracked from try­ing not to laugh.

* * *

There was a hor­ri­ble smell in the kitchen the next morn­ing when Har­ry went in for break­fast. It seemed to be com­ing from a large met­al tub in the sink. He went to have a look. The tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swim­ming in gray wa­ter.

“What’s this?” he asked Aunt Petu­nia. Her lips tight­ened as they al­ways did if he dared to ask a ques­tion.

“Your new school uni­form,” she said.

Har­ry looked in the bowl again.

“Oh,” he said, “I didn’t re­al­ize it had to be so wet.”

“Don’t be stupid,” snapped Aunt Petu­nia. “I’m dye­ing some of Dud­ley’s old things gray for you. It’ll look just like ev­ery­one else’s when I’ve fin­ished.”

Har­ry se­ri­ous­ly doubt­ed this, but thought it best not to ar­gue. He sat down at the ta­ble and tried not to think about how he was go­ing to look on his first day at Stonewall High — like he was wear­ing bits of old ele­phant skin, prob­ably.

Dud­ley and Un­cle Ver­non came in, both with wrin­kled noses be­cause of the smell from Har­ry’s new uni­form. Un­cle Ver­non opened his news­pa­per as usu­al and Dud­ley banged his Smelt­ing stick, which he car­ried ev­ery­where, on the ta­ble.

They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of let­ters on the door­mat.

“Get the mail, Dud­ley,” said Un­cle Ver­non from be­hind his pa­per.

“Make Har­ry get it.”

“Get the mail, Har­ry.”

“Make Dud­ley get it.”

“Poke him with your Smelt­ing stick, Dud­ley.”

Har­ry dodged the Smelt­ing stick and went to get the mail. Three things lay on the door­mat: a post­card from Un­cle Ver­non’s sis­ter Marge, who was va­ca­tion­ing on the Isle of Wight, a brown en­ve­lope that looked like a bill, and — a let­ter for Har­ry.

Har­ry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twang­ing like a gi­ant elas­tic band. No one, ev­er, in his whole life, had writ­ten to him. Who would? He had no friends, no oth­er rel­atives — he didn’t be­long to the li­brary, so he’d nev­er even got rude notes ask­ing for books back. Yet here it was, a let­ter, ad­dressed so plain­ly there could be no mis­take:

Mr. H. Pot­ter

The Cup­board un­der the Stairs

4 Priv­et Drive

Lit­tle Whing­ing

Sur­rey



The en­ve­lope was thick and heavy, made of yel­low­ish parch­ment, and the ad­dress was writ­ten in emer­ald-​green ink. There was no stamp.

Turn­ing the en­ve­lope over, his hand trem­bling, Har­ry saw a pur­ple wax seal bear­ing a coat of arms; a li­on, an ea­gle, a bad­ger, and a snake sur­round­ing a large let­ter H.

“Hur­ry up, boy!” shout­ed Un­cle Ver­non from the kitchen. “What are you do­ing, check­ing for let­ter bombs?” He chuck­led at his own joke.

Har­ry went back to the kitchen, still star­ing at his let­ter. He hand­ed Un­cle Ver­non the bill and the post­card, sat down, and slow­ly be­gan to open the yel­low en­ve­lope.

Un­cle Ver­non ripped open the bill, snort­ed in dis­gust, and flipped over the post­card.

“Marge’s ill,” he in­formed Aunt Petu­nia. “Ate a fun­ny whelk.…”

“Dad!” said Dud­ley sud­den­ly. “Dad, Har­ry’s got some­thing!”

Har­ry was on the point of un­fold­ing his let­ter, which was writ­ten on the same heavy parch­ment as the en­ve­lope, when it was jerked sharply out of his hand by Un­cle Ver­non.

“That’s mine!” said Har­ry, try­ing to snatch it back.

“Who’d be writ­ing to you?” sneered Un­cle Ver­non, shak­ing the let­ter open with one hand and glanc­ing at it. His face went from red to green faster than a set of traf­fic lights. And it didn’t stop there. With­in sec­onds it was the gray­ish white of old por­ridge.

“P-​P-​Petu­nia!” he gasped.

Dud­ley tried to grab the let­ter to read it, but Un­cle Ver­non held it high out of his reach. Aunt Petu­nia took it cu­ri­ous­ly and read the first line. For a mo­ment it looked as though she might faint. She clutched her throat and made a chok­ing noise.

“Ver­non! Oh my good­ness — Ver­non!”

They stared at each oth­er, seem­ing to have for­got­ten that Har­ry and Dud­ley were still in the room. Dud­ley wasn’t used to be­ing ig­nored. He gave his fa­ther a sharp tap on the head with his Smelt­ing stick.

“I want to read that let­ter,” he said loud­ly.

“I want to read it,” said Har­ry fu­ri­ous­ly, “as it’s mine.”

“Get out, both of you,” croaked Un­cle Ver­non, stuff­ing the let­ter back in­side its en­ve­lope.

Har­ry didn’t move.

“I WANT MY LET­TER!” he shout­ed.

“Let me see it!” de­mand­ed Dud­ley.

“OUT!” roared Un­cle Ver­non, and he took both Har­ry and Dud­ley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them in­to the hall, slam­ming the kitchen door be­hind them. Har­ry and Dud­ley prompt­ly had a fu­ri­ous but silent fight over who would lis­ten at the key­hole; Dud­ley won, so Har­ry, his glass­es dan­gling from one ear, lay flat on his stom­ach to lis­ten at the crack be­tween door and floor.

“Ver­non,” Aunt Petu­nia was say­ing in a quiv­er­ing voice, “look at the ad­dress — how could they pos­si­bly know where he sleeps? You don’t think they’re watch­ing the house?”

“Watch­ing — spy­ing — might be fol­low­ing us,” mut­tered Un­cle Ver­non wild­ly.

“But what should we do, Ver­non? Should we write back? Tell them we don’t want —”

Har­ry could see Un­cle Ver­non’s shiny black shoes pac­ing up and down the kitchen.

“No,” he said fi­nal­ly. “No, we’ll ig­nore it. If they don’t get an an­swer…Yes, that’s best…we won’t do any­thing…”

“But —”

“I’m not hav­ing one in the house, Petu­nia! Didn’t we swear when we took him in we’d stamp out that dan­ger­ous non­sense?”



That evening when he got back from work, Un­cle Ver­non did some­thing he’d nev­er done be­fore; he vis­it­ed Har­ry in his cup­board.

“Where’s my let­ter?” said Har­ry, the mo­ment Un­cle Ver­non had squeezed through the door. “Who’s writ­ing to me?”

“No one. It was ad­dressed to you by mis­take,” said Un­cle Ver­non short­ly. “I have burned it.”

“It was not a mis­take,” said Har­ry an­gri­ly, “it had my cup­board on it.”

“SI­LENCE!” yelled Un­cle Ver­non, and a cou­ple of spi­ders fell from the ceil­ing. He took a few deep breaths and then forced his face in­to a smile, which looked quite painful.

“Er — yes, Har­ry — about this cup­board. Your aunt and I have been think­ing…you’re re­al­ly get­ting a bit big for it…we think it might be nice if you moved in­to Dud­ley’s sec­ond bed­room.

“Why?” said Har­ry.

“Don’t ask ques­tions!” snapped his un­cle. “Take this stuff up­stairs, now.”

The Durs­leys’ house had four bed­rooms: one for Un­cle Ver­non and Aunt Petu­nia, one for vis­itors (usu­al­ly Un­cle Ver­non’s sis­ter, Marge), one where Dud­ley slept, and one where Dud­ley kept all the toys and things that wouldn’t fit in­to his first bed­room. It on­ly took Har­ry one trip up­stairs to move ev­ery­thing he owned from the cup­board to this room. He sat down on the bed and stared around him. Near­ly ev­ery­thing in here was bro­ken. The month-​old video cam­era was ly­ing on top of a small, work­ing tank Dud­ley had once driv­en over the next door neigh­bor’s dog; in the cor­ner was Dud­ley’s first-​ev­er tele­vi­sion set, which he’d put his foot through when his fa­vorite pro­gram had been can­celed; there was a large bird­cage, which had once held a par­rot that Dud­ley had swapped at school for a re­al air ri­fle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent be­cause Dud­ley had sat on it. Oth­er shelves were full of books. They were the on­ly things in the room that looked as though they’d nev­er been touched.

From down­stairs came the sound of Dud­ley bawl­ing at his moth­er, I don’t want him in there…I need that room…make him get out...”

Har­ry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yes­ter­day he’d have giv­en any­thing to be up here. To­day he’d rather be back in his cup­board with that let­ter than up here with­out it.



Next morn­ing at break­fast, ev­ery­one was rather qui­et. Dud­ley was in shock. He’d screamed, whacked his fa­ther with his Smelt­ing stick, been sick on pur­pose, kicked his moth­er, and thrown his tor­toise through the green­house roof, and he still didn’t have his room back. Har­ry was think­ing about this time yes­ter­day and bit­ter­ly wish­ing he’d opened the let­ter in the hall. Un­cle Ver­non and Aunt Petu­nia kept look­ing at each oth­er dark­ly.

When the mail ar­rived, Un­cle Ver­non, who seemed to be try­ing to be nice to Har­ry, made Dud­ley go and get it. They heard him bang­ing things with his Smelt­ing stick all the way down the hall. Then he shout­ed, “There’s an­oth­er one! ‘Mr. H. Pot­ter, The Small­est Bed­room, 4 Priv­et Drive —’”

With a stran­gled cry, Un­cle Ver­non leapt from his seat and ran down the hall, Har­ry right be­hind him. Un­cle Ver­non had to wres­tle Dud­ley to the ground to get the let­ter from him, which was made dif­fi­cult by the fact that Har­ry had grabbed Un­cle Ver­non around the neck from be­hind. Af­ter a minute of con­fused fight­ing, in which ev­ery­one got hit a lot by the Smelt­ing stick, Un­cle Ver­non straight­ened up, gasp­ing for breath, with Har­ry’s let­ter clutched in his hand.

“Go to your cup­board — I mean, your bed­room,” he wheezed at Har­ry. “Dud­ley — go — just go.”

Har­ry walked round and round his new room. Some­one knew he had moved out of his cup­board and they seemed to know he hadn’t re­ceived his first let­ter. Sure­ly that meant they’d try again? And this time he’d make sure they didn’t fail. He had a plan.



The re­paired alarm clock rang at six o’clock the next morn­ing. Har­ry turned it off quick­ly and dressed silent­ly. He mustn’t wake the Durs­leys. He stole down­stairs with­out turn­ing on any of the lights.

He was go­ing to wait for the post­man on the cor­ner of Priv­et Drive and get the let­ters for num­ber four first. His heart ham­mered as he crept across the dark hall to­ward the front door —

“AAAAAR­RRGH!”

Har­ry leapt in­to the air; he’d trod­den on some­thing big and squashy on the door­mat — some­thing alive!

Lights clicked on up­stairs and to his hor­ror Har­ry re­al­ized that the big, squashy some­thing had been his un­cle’s face. Un­cle Ver­non had been ly­ing at the foot of the front door in a sleep­ing bag, clear­ly mak­ing sure that Har­ry didn’t do ex­act­ly what he’d been try­ing to do. He shout­ed at Har­ry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea. Har­ry shuf­fled mis­er­ably off in­to the kitchen and by the time he got back, the mail had ar­rived, right in­to Un­cle Ver­non’s lap. Har­ry could see three let­ters ad­dressed in green ink.

“I want —” he be­gan, but Un­cle Ver­non was tear­ing the let­ters in­to pieces be­fore his eyes.

Un­cle Ver­non didn’t go to work that day. He stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot.

“See,” he ex­plained to Aunt Petu­nia through a mouth­ful of nails, “if they can’t de­liv­er them they’ll just give up.”

“I’m not sure that’ll work, Ver­non.”

“Oh, these peo­ple’s minds work in strange ways, Petu­nia, they’re not like you and me,” said Un­cle Ver­non, try­ing to knock in a nail with the piece of fruit­cake Aunt Petu­nia had just brought him.



On Fri­day, no less than twelve let­ters ar­rived for Har­ry. As they couldn’t go through the mail slot they had been pushed un­der the door, slot­ted through the sides, and a few even forced through the small win­dow in the down­stairs bath­room.

Un­cle Ver­non stayed at home again. Af­ter burn­ing all the let­ters, he got out a ham­mer and nails and board­ed up the cracks around the front and back doors so no one could go out. He hummed “Tip­toe Through the Tulips” as he worked, and jumped at small nois­es.



On Sat­ur­day, things be­gan to get out of hand. Twen­ty-​four let­ters to Har­ry found their way in­to the house, rolled up and hid­den in­side each of the two dozen eggs that their very con­fused milk­man had hand­ed Aunt Petu­nia through the liv­ing room win­dow. While Un­cle Ver­non made fu­ri­ous tele­phone calls to the post of­fice and the dairy try­ing to find some­one to com­plain to, Aunt Petu­nia shred­ded the let­ters in her food pro­ces­sor.

“Who on earth wants to talk to you this bad­ly?” Dud­ley asked Har­ry in amaze­ment.

* * *

On Sun­day morn­ing, Un­cle Ver­non sat down at the break­fast ta­ble look­ing tired and rather ill, but hap­py.

“No post on Sun­days,” he re­mind­ed them cheer­ful­ly as he spread mar­malade on his news­pa­pers, “no damn let­ters to­day —”

Some­thing came whizzing down the kitchen chim­ney as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head. Next mo­ment, thir­ty or forty let­ters came pelt­ing out of the fire­place like bul­lets. The Durs­leys ducked, but Har­ry leapt in­to the air try­ing to catch one —

“Out! OUT!”

Un­cle Ver­non seized Har­ry around the waist and threw him in­to the hall. When Aunt Petu­nia and Dud­ley had run out with their arms over their faces, Un­cle Ver­non slammed the door shut. They could hear the let­ters still stream­ing in­to the room, bounc­ing off the walls and floor.

“That does it,” said Un­cle Ver­non, try­ing to speak calm­ly but pulling great tufts out of his mus­tache at the same time. “I want you all back here in five min­utes ready to leave. We’re go­ing away. Just pack some clothes. No ar­gu­ments!”

He looked so dan­ger­ous with half his mus­tache miss­ing that no one dared ar­gue. Ten min­utes lat­er they had wrenched their way through the board­ed-​up doors and were in the car, speed­ing to­ward the high­way. Dud­ley was snif­fling in the back seat; his fa­ther had hit him round the head for hold­ing them up while he tried to pack his tele­vi­sion, VCR, and com­put­er in his sports bag.

They drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petu­nia didn’t dare ask where they were go­ing. Ev­ery now and then Un­cle Ver­non would take a sharp turn and drive in the op­po­site di­rec­tion for a while.

“Shake ’em off…shake ’em off,” he would mut­ter when­ev­er he did this.

They didn’t stop to eat or drink all day. By night­fall Dud­ley was howl­ing. He’d nev­er had such a bad day in his life. He was hun­gry, he’d missed five tele­vi­sion pro­grams he’d want­ed to see, and he’d nev­er gone so long with­out blow­ing up an alien on his com­put­er.

Un­cle Ver­non stopped at last out­side a gloomy-​look­ing ho­tel on the out­skirts of a big city. Dud­ley and Har­ry shared a room with twin beds and damp, musty sheets. Dud­ley snored but Har­ry stayed awake, sit­ting on the win­dowsill, star­ing down at the lights of pass­ing cars and won­der­ing.…



They ate stale corn­flakes and cold tinned toma­toes on toast for break­fast the next day. They had just fin­ished when the own­er of the ho­tel came over to their ta­ble.

“’Scuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Pot­ter? On­ly I got about an ’un­dred of these at the front desk.”

She held up a let­ter so they could read the green ink ad­dress:



Mr. H. Pot­ter

Room 17

Rail­view Ho­tel

Coke­worth



Har­ry made a grab for the let­ter but Un­cle Ver­non knocked his hand out of the way. The wom­an stared.

“I’ll take them,” said Un­cle Ver­non, stand­ing up quick­ly and fol­low­ing her from the din­ing room.

* * *

“Wouldn’t it be bet­ter just to go home, dear?” Aunt Petu­nia sug­gest­ed timid­ly, hours lat­er, but Un­cle Ver­non didn’t seem to hear her. Ex­act­ly what he was look­ing for, none of them knew. He drove them in­to the mid­dle of a for­est, got out, looked around, shook his head, got back in the car, and off they went again. The same thing hap­pened in the mid­dle of a plowed field, halfway across a sus­pen­sion bridge, and at the top of a mul­ti­level park­ing garage.

“Dad­dy’s gone mad, hasn’t he?” Dud­ley asked Aunt Petu­nia dul­ly late that af­ter­noon. Un­cle Ver­non had parked at the coast, locked them all in­side the car, and dis­ap­peared.

It start­ed to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dud­ley sniveled.

“It’s Mon­day,” he told his moth­er. “The Great Hum­ber­to’s on tonight. I want to stay some­where with a tele­vi­sion.”

Mon­day. This re­mind­ed Har­ry of some­thing. If it was Mon­day — and you could usu­al­ly count on Dud­ley to know the days the week, be­cause of tele­vi­sion — then to­mor­row, Tues­day, was Har­ry’s eleventh birth­day. Of course, his birth­days were nev­er ex­act­ly fun — last year, the Durs­leys had giv­en him a coat hang­er and a pair of Un­cle Ver­non’s old socks. Still, you weren’t eleven ev­ery day.

Un­cle Ver­non was back and he was smil­ing. He was al­so car­ry­ing a long, thin pack­age and didn’t an­swer Aunt Petu­nia when she asked what he’d bought.

“Found the per­fect place!” he said. “Come on! Ev­ery­one out!”

It was very cold out­side the car. Un­cle Ver­non was point­ing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea. Perched on top of the rock was the most mis­er­able lit­tle shack you could imag­ine. One thing was cer­tain, there was no tele­vi­sion in there.

“Storm fore­cast for tonight!” said Un­cle Ver­non glee­ful­ly, clap­ping his hands to­geth­er. “And this gen­tle­man’s kind­ly agreed to lend us his boat!”

A tooth­less old man came am­bling up to them, point­ing, with a rather wicked grin, at an old row­boat bob­bing in the iron-​gray wa­ter be­low them.

“I’ve al­ready got us some ra­tions,” said Un­cle Ver­non, “so all aboard!”

It was freez­ing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces. Af­ter what seemed like hours they reached the rock, where Un­cle Ver­non, slip­ping and slid­ing, led the way to the bro­ken-​down house.

The in­side was hor­ri­ble; it smelled strong­ly of sea­weed, the wind whis­tled through the gaps in the wood­en walls, and the fire­place was damp and emp­ty. There were on­ly two rooms.

Un­cle Ver­non’s ra­tions turned out to be a bag of chips each and four ba­nanas. He tried to start a fire but the emp­ty chip bags just smoked and shriv­eled up.

“Could do with some of those let­ters now, eh?” he said cheer­ful­ly.

He was in a very good mood. Ob­vi­ous­ly he thought no­body stood a chance of reach­ing them here in a storm to de­liv­er mail. Har­ry pri­vate­ly agreed, though the thought didn’t cheer him up at all.

As night fell, the promised storm blew up around them. Spray from the high waves splat­tered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rat­tled the filthy win­dows. Aunt Petu­nia found a few moldy blan­kets in the sec­ond room and made up a bed for Dud­ley on the moth-​eat­en so­fa. She and Un­cle Ver­non went off to the lumpy bed next door, and Har­ry was left to find the soft­est bit of floor he could and to curl up un­der the thinnest, most ragged blan­ket.

The storm raged more and more fe­ro­cious­ly as the night went on. Har­ry couldn’t sleep. He shiv­ered and turned over, try­ing to get com­fort­able, his stom­ach rum­bling with hunger. Dud­ley’s snores were drowned by the low rolls of thun­der that start­ed near mid­night. The light­ed di­al of Dud­ley’s watch, which was dan­gling over the edge of the so­fa on his fat wrist, told Har­ry he’d be eleven in ten min­utes’ time. He lay and watched his birth­day tick near­er, won­der­ing if the Durs­leys would re­mem­ber at all, won­der­ing where the let­ter writ­er was now.

Five min­utes to go. Har­ry heard some­thing creak out­side. He hoped the roof wasn’t go­ing to fall in, al­though he might be warmer if it did. Four min­utes to go. Maybe the house in Priv­et Drive would be so full of let­ters when they got back that he’d be able to steal one some­how.

Three min­utes to go. Was that the sea, slap­ping hard on the rock like that? And (two min­utes to go) what was that fun­ny crunch­ing noise? Was the rock crum­bling in­to the sea?

One minute to go and he’d be eleven. Thir­ty sec­onds...twen­ty…ten…nine — maybe he’d wake Dud­ley up, just to an­noy him — three…two…one…

BOOM.

The whole shack shiv­ered and Har­ry sat bolt up­right, star­ing at the door. Some­one was out­side, knock­ing to come in.

CHAPTER FOUR




THE KEEP­ER OF THE KEYS



B OOM. They knocked again. Dud­ley jerked awake.

“Where’s the can­non?” he said stupid­ly.

There was a crash be­hind them and Un­cle Ver­non came skid­ding in­to the room. He was hold­ing a ri­fle in his hands – now they knew what had been in the long, thin pack­age he had brought with them.

“Who’s there?” he shout­ed. “I warn you — I’m armed!”

There was a pause. Then —

SMASH!

The door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and with a deaf­en­ing crash land­ed flat on the floor.

A gi­ant of a man was stand­ing in the door­way. His face was al­most com­plete­ly hid­den by a long, shag­gy mane of hair and a wild, tan­gled beard, but you could make out his eyes, glint­ing like black bee­tles un­der all the hair.

The gi­ant squeezed his way in­to the hut, stoop­ing so that his head just brushed the ceil­ing. He bent down, picked up the door, and fit­ted it eas­ily back in­to its frame. The noise of the storm out­side dropped a lit­tle. He turned to look at them all.

“Couldn’t make us a cup o’ tea, could yeh? It’s not been an easy jour­ney.…”

He strode over to the so­fa where Dud­ley sat frozen with fear.

“Budge up, yeh great lump,” said the stranger.

Dud­ley squeaked and ran to hide be­hind his moth­er, who was crouch­ing, ter­ri­fied, be­hind Un­cle Ver­non.

“An’ here’s Har­ry!” said the gi­ant.

Har­ry looked up in­to the fierce, wild, shad­owy face and saw that the bee­tle eyes were crin­kled in a smile.

“Las’ time I saw you, you was on­ly a ba­by,” said the gi­ant. “Yeh look a lot like yer dad, but yeh’ve got yer mom’s eyes.”

Un­cle Ver­non made a fun­ny rasp­ing noise.

“I de­mand that you leave at once, sir!” he said. “You are break­ing and en­ter­ing!”

“Ah, shut up, Durs­ley, yeh great prune,” said the gi­ant; he reached over the back of the so­fa, jerked the gun out of Un­cle Ver­non’s hands, bent it in­to a knot as eas­ily as if it had been made of rub­ber, and threw it in­to a cor­ner of the room.

Un­cle Ver­non made an­oth­er fun­ny noise, like a mouse be­ing trod­den on.

“Any­way — Har­ry,” said the gi­ant, turn­ing his back on the Durs­leys, “a very hap­py birth­day to yeh. Got sum­mat fer yeh here — I migh­ta sat on it at some point, but it’ll taste all right.”

From an in­side pock­et of his black over­coat he pulled a slight­ly squashed box. Har­ry opened it with trem­bling fin­gers. In­side was a large, sticky choco­late cake with Hap­py Birth­day Har­ry writ­ten on it in green ic­ing.

Har­ry looked up at the gi­ant. He meant to say thank you, but the words got lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said in­stead was, “Who are you?”

The gi­ant chuck­led.

“True, I haven’t in­tro­duced me­self. Rubeus Ha­grid, Keep­er of Keys and Grounds at Hog­warts.”

He held out an enor­mous hand and shook Har­ry’s whole arm.

“What about that tea then, eh?” he said, rub­bing his hands to­geth­er. “I’d not say no ter sum­mat stronger if yeh’ve got it, mind.”

His eyes fell on the emp­ty grate with the shriv­eled chip bags in it and he snort­ed. He bent down over the fire­place; they couldn’t see what he was do­ing but when he drew back a sec­ond lat­er, there was a roar­ing fire there. It filled the whole damp hut with flick­er­ing light and Har­ry felt the warmth wash over him as though he’d sunk in­to a hot bath.

The gi­ant sat back down on the so­fa, which sagged un­der his weight, and be­gan tak­ing all sorts of things out of the pock­ets of his coat: a cop­per ket­tle, a squashy pack­age of sausages, a pok­er, a teapot, sev­er­al chipped mugs, and a bot­tle of some am­ber liq­uid that he took a swig from be­fore start­ing to make tea. Soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of siz­zling sausage. No­body said a thing while the gi­ant was work­ing, but as he slid the first six fat, juicy, slight­ly burnt sausages from the pok­er, Dud­ley fid­get­ed a lit­tle. Un­cle Ver­non said sharply, “Don’t touch any­thing he gives you, Dud­ley.”

The gi­ant chuck­led dark­ly.

“Yer great pud­din’ of a son don’ need fat­tenin’ any­more, Durs­ley, don’ wor­ry.”

He passed the sausages to Har­ry, who was so hun­gry he had nev­er tast­ed any­thing so won­der­ful, but he still couldn’t take his eyes off the gi­ant. Fi­nal­ly, as no­body seemed about to ex­plain any­thing, he said, “I’m sor­ry, but I still don’t re­al­ly know who you are.”

The gi­ant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.

“Call me Ha­grid,” he said, “ev­ery­one does. An’ like I told yeh, I’m Keep­er of Keys at Hog­warts — yeh’ll know all about Hog­warts, o’ course.

“Er — no,” said Har­ry.

Ha­grid looked shocked.

“Sor­ry,” Har­ry said quick­ly.

“Sor­ry?” barked Ha­grid, turn­ing to stare at the Durs­leys, who shrank back in­to the shad­ows. “It’s them as should be sor­ry! I knew yeh weren’t get­tin’ yer let­ters but I nev­er thought yeh wouldn’t even know abou’ Hog­warts, fer cryin’ out loud! Did yeh nev­er won­der where yer par­ents learned it all?”

“All what?” asked Har­ry.

“ALL WHAT?” Ha­grid thun­dered. “Now wait jus’ one sec­ond!”

He had leapt to his feet. In his anger he seemed to fill the whole hut. The Durs­leys were cow­er­ing against the wall.

“Do you mean ter tell me,” he growled at the Durs­leys, “that this boy — this boy! — knows noth­in’ abou’ — about ANY­THING?”

Har­ry thought this was go­ing a bit far. He had been to school, af­ter all, and his marks weren’t bad.

“I know some things,” he said. “I can, you know, do math and stuff.”

But Ha­grid sim­ply waved his hand and said, “About our world, I mean. Your world. My world. Yer par­ents’ world.”

“What world?”

Ha­grid looked as if he was about to ex­plode.

“DURS­LEY!” he boomed.

Un­cle Ver­non, who had gone very pale, whis­pered some­thing that sound­ed like “Mim­blewim­ble.” Ha­grid stared wild­ly at Har­ry.

“But yeh must know about yer mom and dad,” he said. “I mean, they’re fa­mous. You’re fa­mous.”

“What? My — my mom and dad weren’t fa­mous, were they?”

“Yeh don’ know...yeh don’ know....” Ha­grid ran his fin­gers through his hair, fix­ing Har­ry with a be­wil­dered stare.

“Yeh don’ know what yeh are?” he said fi­nal­ly.

Un­cle Ver­non sud­den­ly found his voice.

“Stop!” he com­mand­ed. “Stop right there, sir! I for­bid you to tell the boy any­thing!”

A braver man than Ver­non Durs­ley would have quailed un­der the fu­ri­ous look Ha­grid now gave him; when Ha­grid spoke, his ev­ery syl­la­ble trem­bled with rage.

“You nev­er told him? Nev­er told him what was in the let­ter Dum­ble­dore left fer him? I was there! I saw Dum­ble­dore leave it, Durs­ley! An’ you’ve kept it from him all these years?”

“Kept what from me?” said Har­ry ea­ger­ly.

“STOP! I FOR­BID YOU!” yelled Un­cle Ver­non in pan­ic.

Aunt Petu­nia gave a gasp of hor­ror.

“Ah, go boil yer heads, both of yeh,” said Ha­grid. “Har­ry — yer a wiz­ard.”

There was si­lence in­side the hut. On­ly the sea and the whistling wind could be heard.

“I’m a what?” gasped Har­ry.

“A wiz­ard, o’ course,” said Ha­grid, sit­ting back down on the so­fa, which groaned and sank even low­er, “an’ a thumpin’ good ‘un, I’d say, once yeh’ve been trained up a bit. With a mum an’ dad like yours, what else would yeh be? An’ I reck­on it’s abou’ time yeh read yer let­ter.”

Har­ry stretched out his hand at last to take the yel­low­ish en­ve­lope, ad­dressed in emer­ald green to Mr. H. Pot­ter, The Floor, Hut-​on-​the-​Rock, The Sea. He pulled out the let­ter and read:



HOG­WARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZ­ARDRY



Head­mas­ter: AL­BUS DUM­BLE­DORE

(Or­der of Mer­lin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf. War­lock, Supreme Mug­wump, In­ter­na­tion­al Con­fed. of Wiz­ards)



Dear Mr. Pot­ter,

We are pleased to in­form you that you have been ac­cept­ed at Hog­warts School of Witchcraft and Wiz­ardry. Please find en­closed a list of all nec­es­sary books and equip­ment.

Term be­gins on Septem­ber 1. We await your owl by no lat­er than Ju­ly 31.

Yours sin­cere­ly,



Min­er­va McG­ona­gall,

Deputy Head­mistress



Ques­tions ex­plod­ed in­side Har­ry’s head like fire­works and he couldn’t de­cide which to ask first. Af­ter a few min­utes he stam­mered, “What does it mean, they await my owl?”

“Gal­lopin’ Gor­gons, that re­minds me,” said Ha­grid, clap­ping a hand to his fore­head with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from yet an­oth­er pock­et in­side his over­coat he pulled an owl — a re­al, live, rather ruf­fled-​look­ing owl — a long quill, and a roll of parch­ment. With his tongue be­tween his teeth he scrib­bled a note that Har­ry could read up­side down:



Dear Pro­fes­sor Dum­ble­dore,

Giv­en Har­ry his let­ter.

Tak­ing him to buy his things to­mor­row.

Weath­er’s hor­ri­ble. Hope you’re well.

Ha­grid



Ha­grid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which clamped it in its beak, went to the door, and threw the owl out in­to the storm. Then he came back and sat down as though this was as nor­mal as talk­ing on the tele­phone.

Har­ry re­al­ized his mouth was open and closed it quick­ly.

“Where was I?” said Ha­grid, but at that mo­ment, Un­cle Ver­non, still ashen-​faced but look­ing very an­gry, moved in­to the fire­light.

“He’s not go­ing,” he said.

Ha­grid grunt­ed.

“I’d like ter see a great Mug­gle like you stop him,” he said.

“A what?” said Har­ry, in­ter­est­ed.

“A Mug­gle,” said Ha­grid, “it’s what we call non­mag­ic folk like them. An’ it’s your bad luck you grew up in a fam­ily o’ the biggest Mug­gles I ev­er laid eyes on.”

“We swore when we took him in we’d put a stop to that rub­bish,” said Un­cle Ver­non, “swore we’d stamp it out of him! Wiz­ard in­deed!”

“You knew?” said Har­ry. “You knew I’m a — a wiz­ard?”

“Knew!” shrieked Aunt Petu­nia sud­den­ly. “Knew! Of course we knew! How could you not be, my drat­ted sis­ter be­ing what she was? Oh, she got a let­ter just like that and dis­ap­peared off to that — that school — and came home ev­ery va­ca­tion with her pock­ets full of frog spawn, turn­ing teacups in­to rats. I was the on­ly one who saw her for what she was — a freak! But for my moth­er and fa­ther, oh no, it was Lily this and Lily that, they were proud of hav­ing a witch in the fam­ily!”

She stopped to draw a deep breath and then went rant­ing on. It seemed she had been want­ing to say all this for years.

“Then she met that Pot­ter at school and they left and got mar­ried and had you, and of course I knew you’d be just the same, just as strange, just as — as — ab­nor­mal — and then, if you please, she went and got her­self blown up and we got land­ed with you!”

Har­ry had gone very white. As soon as he found his voice he said, “Blown up? You told me they died in a car crash!”

“CAR CRASH!” roared Ha­grid, jump­ing up so an­gri­ly that the Durs­leys scut­tled back to their cor­ner. “How could a car crash kill Lily an’ James Pot­ter? It’s an out­rage! A scan­dal! Har­ry Pot­ter not knowin’ his own sto­ry when ev­ery kid in our world knows his name!”

“But why? What hap­pened?” Har­ry asked ur­gent­ly.

The anger fad­ed from Ha­grid’s face. He looked sud­den­ly anx­ious.

“I nev­er ex­pect­ed this,” he said, in a low, wor­ried voice. “I had no idea, when Dum­ble­dore told me there might be trou­ble get­tin’ hold of yeh, how much yeh didn’t know. Ah, Har­ry, I don’ know if I’m the right per­son ter tell yeh — but some­one’s got­ta — yeh can’t go off ter Hog­warts not knowin’.”

He threw a dirty look at the Durs­leys.

“Well, it’s best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh — mind, I can’t tell yeh ev­ery­thin’, it’s a great myst’ry, parts of it.…”

He sat down, stared in­to the fire for a few sec­onds, and then said, “It be­gins, I sup­pose, with — with a per­son called — but it’s in­cred­ible yeh don’t know his name, ev­ery­one in our world knows —”

“Who?”

“Well — I don’ like sayin’ the name if I can help it. No one does.”

“Why not?”

“Gulpin’ gar­goyles, Har­ry, peo­ple are still scared. Blimey, this is dif­fi­cult. See, there was this wiz­ard who went ...bad. As bad as you could go. Worse. Worse than worse. His name was...”

Ha­grid gulped, but no words came out.

“Could you write it down?” Har­ry sug­gest­ed.

“Nah — can’t spell it. All right — Volde­mort. ” Ha­grid shud­dered. “Don’ make me say it again. Any­way, this — this wiz­ard, about twen­ty years ago now, start­ed lookin’ fer fol­low­ers. Got ‘em, too — some were afraid, some just want­ed a bit o’ his pow­er, ‘cause he was get­tin’ him­self pow­er, all right. Dark days, Har­ry. Didn’t know who ter trust, didn’t dare get friend­ly with strange wiz­ards or witch­es…ter­ri­ble things hap­pened. He was takin’ over. ‘Course, some stood up to him — an’ he killed ‘em. Hor­ri­bly. One o’ the on­ly safe places left was Hog­warts. Reck­on Dum­ble­dore’s the on­ly one You-​Know-​Who was afraid of. Didn’t dare try takin’ the school, not jus’ then, any­way.

“Now, yer mum an’ dad were as good a witch an’ wiz­ard as I ev­er knew. Head boy an’ girl at Hog­warts in their day! Sup­pose the myst’ry is why You-​Know-​Who nev­er tried to get ‘em on his side be­fore…prob­ably knew they were too close ter Dum­ble­dore ter want any­thin’ ter do with the Dark Side.

“Maybe he thought he could per­suade ‘em...maybe he just want­ed ‘em out­ta the way. All any­one knows is, he turned up in the vil­lage where you was all liv­ing, on Hal­loween ten years ago. You was just a year old. He came ter yer house an’ — an’ —”

Ha­grid sud­den­ly pulled out a very dirty, spot­ted hand­ker­chief and blew his nose with a sound like a foghorn.

“Sor­ry,” he said. “But it’s that sad — knew yer mum an’ dad, an’ nicer peo­ple yeh couldn’t find — any­way….

“You-​Know-​Who killed ‘em. An’ then — an’ this is the re­al myst’ry of the thing — he tried to kill you, too. Want­ed ter make a clean job of it, I sup­pose, or maybe he just liked killin’ by then. But he couldn’t do it. Nev­er won­dered how you got that mark on yer fore­head? That was no or­di­nary cut. That’s what yeh get when a pow­er­ful, evil curse touch­es yeh — took care of yer mum an’ dad an’ yer house, even — but it didn’t work on you, an’ that’s why yer fa­mous, Har­ry. No one ev­er lived af­ter he de­cid­ed ter kill ’em, no one ex­cept you, an’ he’d killed some o’ the best witch­es an’ wiz­ards of the age — the McK­in­nons, the Bones, the Prewetts — an’ you was on­ly a ba­by, an’ you lived.”

Some­thing very painful was go­ing on in Har­ry’s mind. As Ha­grid’s sto­ry came to a close, he saw again the blind­ing flash of green light, more clear­ly than he had ev­er re­mem­bered it be­fore — and he re­mem­bered some­thing else, for the first time in his life: a high, cold, cru­el laugh.

Ha­grid was watch­ing him sad­ly.

“Took yeh from the ru­ined house my­self, on Dum­ble­dore’s or­ders. Brought yeh ter this lot….”

“Load of old tosh,” said Un­cle Ver­non. Har­ry jumped; he had al­most for­got­ten that the Durs­leys were there. Un­cle Ver­non cer­tain­ly seemed to have got back his courage. He was glar­ing at Ha­grid and his fists were clenched.

“Now, you lis­ten here, boy,” he snarled, “I ac­cept there’s some­thing strange about you, prob­ably noth­ing a good beat­ing wouldn’t have cured — and as for all this about your par­ents, well, they were weir­does, no deny­ing it, and the world’s bet­ter off with­out them in my opin­ion — asked for all they got, get­ting mixed up with these wiz­ard­ing types — just what I ex­pect­ed, al­ways knew they’d come to a sticky end —”

But at that mo­ment, Ha­grid leapt from the so­fa and drew a bat­tered pink um­brel­la from in­side his coat. Point­ing this at Un­cle Ver­non like a sword, he said, “I’m warn­ing you, Durs­ley — I’m warn­ing you — one more word….”

In dan­ger of be­ing speared on the end of an um­brel­la by a beard­ed gi­ant, Un­cle Ver­non’s courage failed again; he flat­tened him­self against the wall and fell silent.

“That’s bet­ter,” said Ha­grid, breath­ing heav­ily and sit­ting back down on the so­fa, which this time sagged right down to the floor.

Har­ry, mean­while, still had ques­tions to ask, hun­dreds of them.

“But what hap­pened to Vol-, sor­ry — I mean, You-​Know-​Who?”

“Good ques­tion, Har­ry. Dis­ap­peared. Van­ished. Same night he tried ter kill you. Makes yeh even more fa­mous. That’s the biggest myst’ry, see…he was get­tin’ more an’ more pow­er­ful — why’d he go?

“Some say he died. Codswal­lop, in my opin­ion. Dun­no if he had enough hu­man left in him to die. Some say he’s still out there, bidin’ his time, like, but I don’ be­lieve it. Peo­ple who was on his side came back ter ours. Some of ‘em came out­ta kin­da trances. Don’ reck­on they could’ve done if he was comin’ back.

“Most of us reck­on he’s still out there some­where but lost his pow­ers. Too weak to car­ry on. ’Cause some­thin’ about you fin­ished him, Har­ry. There was some­thin’ goin’ on that night he hadn’t count­ed on — I dun­no what it was, no one does — but some­thin’ about you stumped him, all right.”

Ha­grid looked at Har­ry with warmth and re­spect blaz­ing in his eyes, but Har­ry, in­stead of feel­ing pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been a hor­ri­ble mis­take. A wiz­ard? Him? How could he pos­si­bly be? He’d spent his life be­ing clout­ed by Dud­ley, and bul­lied by Aunt Petu­nia and Un­cle Ver­non; if he was re­al­ly a wiz­ard, why hadn’t they been turned in­to warty toads ev­ery time they’d tried to lock him in his cup­board? If he’d once de­feat­ed the great­est sor­cer­er in the world, how come Dud­ley had al­ways been able to kick him around like a foot­ball?

“Ha­grid,” he said qui­et­ly, “I think you must have made a mis­take. I don’t think I can be a wiz­ard.”

To his sur­prise, Ha­grid chuck­led.

“Not a wiz­ard, eh? Nev­er made things hap­pen when you was scared or an­gry?”

Har­ry looked in­to the fire. Now he came to think about it…ev­ery odd thing that had ev­er made his aunt and un­cle fu­ri­ous with him had hap­pened when he, Har­ry, had been up­set or an­gry…chased by Dud­ley’s gang, he had some­how found him­self out of their reach…dread­ing go­ing to school with that ridicu­lous hair­cut, he’d man­aged to make it grow back...and the very last time Dud­ley had hit him, hadn’t he got his re­venge, with­out even re­al­iz­ing he was do­ing it? Hadn’t he set a boa con­stric­tor on him?

Har­ry looked back at Ha­grid, smil­ing, and saw that Ha­grid was pos­itive­ly beam­ing at him.

“See?” said Ha­grid. “Har­ry Pot­ter, not a wiz­ard — you wait, you’ll be right fa­mous at Hog­warts.”

But Un­cle Ver­non wasn’t go­ing to give in with­out a fight.

“Haven’t I told you he’s not go­ing?” he hissed. “He’s go­ing to Stonewall High and he’ll be grate­ful for it. I’ve read those let­ters and he needs all sorts of rub­bish — spell books and wands and —”

“If he wants ter go, a great Mug­gle like you won’t stop him,” growled Ha­grid. “Stop Lily an’ James Pot­ter’s son goin’ ter Hog­warts! Yer mad. His name’s been down ev­er since he was born. He’s off ter the finest school of witchcraft and wiz­ardry in the world. Sev­en years there and he won’t know him­self. He’ll be with young­sters of his own sort, fer a change, an’ he’ll be un­der the great­est head­mas­ter Hog­warts ev­er had Al­bus Dum­bled—”

“I AM NOT PAY­ING FOR SOME CRACK­POT OLD FOOL TO TEACH HIM MAG­IC TRICKS!” yelled Un­cle Ver­non.

But he had fi­nal­ly gone too far. Ha­grid seized his um­brel­la and whirled it over his head, “NEV­ER —” he thun­dered, “— IN­SULT — AL­BUS — DUM­BLE­DORE — IN — FRONT — OF — ME!”

He brought the um­brel­la swish­ing down through the air to point at Dud­ley — there was a flash of vi­olet light, a sound like a fire­crack­er, a sharp squeal, and the next sec­ond, Dud­ley was danc­ing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bot­tom, howl­ing in pain. When he turned his back on them, Har­ry saw a curly pig’s tail pok­ing through a hole in his trousers.

Un­cle Ver­non roared. Pulling Aunt Petu­nia and Dud­ley in­to the oth­er room, he cast one last ter­ri­fied look at Ha­grid and slammed the door be­hind them.

Ha­grid looked down at his um­brel­la and stroked his beard.

“Shouldn’ta lost me tem­per,” he said rue­ful­ly, “but it didn’t work any­way. Meant ter turn him in­to a pig, but I sup­pose he was so much like a pig any­way there wasn’t much left ter do.”

He cast a side­ways look at Har­ry un­der his bushy eye­brows.

“Be grate­ful if yeh didn’t men­tion that ter any­one at Hog­warts,” he said. “I’m — er — not sup­posed ter do mag­ic, strict­ly speakin’. I was al­lowed ter do a bit ter fol­low yeh an’ get yer let­ters to yeh an’ stuff — one o’ the rea­sons I was so keen ter take on the job.”

“Why aren’t you sup­posed to do mag­ic?” asked Har­ry.

“Oh, well — I was at Hog­warts me­self but I — er — got ex­pelled, ter tell yeh the truth. In me third year. They snapped me wand in half an’ ev­ery­thing. But Dum­ble­dore let me stay on as game­keep­er. Great man, Dum­ble­dore.”

“Why were you ex­pelled?”

“It’s get­tin’ late and we’ve got lots ter do to­mor­row,” said Ha­grid loud­ly. “Got­ta get up ter town, get all yer books an’ that.”

He took off his thick black coat and threw it to Har­ry.

“You can kip un­der that,” he said. “Don’ mind if it wrig­gles a bit, I think I still got a cou­ple o’ doormice in one o’ the pock­ets.”





HP 1 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone





CHAPTER FIVE




DI­AGON AL­LEY



H ar­ry woke ear­ly the next morn­ing. Al­though he could tell it was day­light, he kept his eyes shut tight.

“It was a dream, he told him­self firm­ly. “I dreamed a gi­ant called Ha­grid came to tell me I was go­ing to a school for wiz­ards. When I open my eyes I’ll be at home in my cup­board.”

There was sud­den­ly a loud tap­ping noise.

And there’s Aunt Petu­nia knock­ing on the door, Har­ry thought, his heart sink­ing. But he still didn’t open his eyes. It had been such a good dream.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

“All right,” Har­ry mum­bled, “I’m get­ting up.”

He sat up and Ha­grid’s heavy coat fell off him. The hut was full of sun­light, the storm was over, Ha­grid him­self was asleep on the col­lapsed so­fa, and there was an owl rap­ping its claw on the win­dow, a news­pa­per held in its beak.

Har­ry scram­bled to his feet, so hap­py he felt as though a large bal­loon was swelling in­side him. He went straight to the win­dow and jerked it open. The owl swooped in and dropped the news­pa­per on top of Ha­grid, who didn’t wake up. The owl then flut­tered on­to the floor and be­gan to at­tack Ha­grid’s coat.

“Don’t do that.”

Har­ry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its beak fierce­ly at him and car­ried on sav­aging the coat.

“Ha­grid!” said Har­ry loud­ly. “There’s an owl —”

“Pay him,” Ha­grid grunt­ed in­to the so­fa.

“What?”

“He wants payin’ fer de­liv­erin’ the pa­per. Look in the pock­ets.”

Ha­grid’s coat seemed to be made of noth­ing but pock­ets — bunch­es of keys, slug pel­lets, balls of string, pep­per­mint hum­bugs, teabags...fi­nal­ly, Har­ry pulled out a hand­ful of strange-​look­ing coins.

“Give him five Knuts,” said Ha­grid sleep­ily.

“Knuts?”

“The lit­tle bronze ones.”

Har­ry count­ed out five lit­tle bronze coins, and the owl held out his leg so Har­ry could put the mon­ey in­to a small leather pouch tied to it. Then he flew off through the open win­dow.

Ha­grid yawned loud­ly, sat up, and stretched.

“Best be off, Har­ry, lots ter do to­day, got­ta get up ter Lon­don an’ buy all yer stuff fer school.”

Har­ry was turn­ing over the wiz­ard coins and look­ing at them. He had just thought of some­thing that made him feel as though the hap­py bal­loon in­side him had got a punc­ture.

“Um — Ha­grid?”

“Mm?” said Ha­grid, who was pulling on his huge boots.

“I haven’t got any mon­ey — and you heard Un­cle Ver­non last night…he won’t pay for me to go and learn mag­ic.”

“Don’t wor­ry about that,” said Ha­grid, stand­ing up and scratch­ing his head. “D’yeh think yer par­ents didn’t leave yeh any­thing?”

“But if their house was de­stroyed —”

“They didn’ keep their gold in the house, boy! Nah, first stop fer us is Gringotts. Wiz­ards’ bank. Have a sausage, they’re not bad cold — an’ I wouldn’ say no teh a bit o’ yer birth­day cake, nei­ther.”

“Wiz­ards have banks?”

“Just the one. Gringotts. Run by gob­lins.”

Har­ry dropped the bit of sausage he was hold­ing.

“Gob­lins?”

“Yeah — so yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it, I’ll tell yeh that. Nev­er mess with gob­lins, Har­ry. Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer any­thing yeh want ter keep safe — ‘cept maybe Hog­warts. As a mat­ter o’ fact, I got­ta vis­it Gringotts any­way. Fer Dum­ble­dore. Hog­warts busi­ness.” Ha­grid drew him­self up proud­ly. “He usu­al­ly gets me ter do im­por­tant stuff fer him. Fetchin’ you — get­tin’ things from Gringotts — knows he can trust me, see.”

“Got ev­ery­thin’? Come on, then.”

Har­ry fol­lowed Ha­grid out on­to the rock. The sky was quite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sun­light. The boat Un­cle Ver­non had hired was still there, with a lot of wa­ter in the bot­tom af­ter the storm.

“How did you get here?” Har­ry asked, look­ing around for an­oth­er boat.

“Flew,” said Ha­grid.

“Flew?”

“Yeah — but we’ll go back in this. Not s’pposed ter use mag­ic now I’ve got yeh.”

They set­tled down in the boat, Har­ry still star­ing at Ha­grid, try­ing to imag­ine him fly­ing.

“Seems a shame ter row, though,” said Ha­grid, giv­ing Har­ry an­oth­er of his side­ways looks. “If I was ter — er — speed things up a bit, would yeh mind not men­tion­in’ it at Hog­warts?”

“Of course not,” said Har­ry, ea­ger to see more mag­ic. Ha­grid pulled out the pink um­brel­la again, tapped it twice on the side of the boat, and they sped off to­ward land.

“Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?” Har­ry asked.

“Spells — en­chant­ments,” said Ha­grid, un­fold­ing his news­pa­per as he spoke. “They say there’s drag­ons guardin’ the high se­cu­ri­ty vaults. And then yeh got­ta find yer way — Gringotts is hun­dreds of miles un­der Lon­don, see. Deep un­der the Un­der­ground. Yeh’d die of hunger tryin’ ter get out, even if yeh did man­age ter get yer hands on sum­mat.”

Har­ry sat and thought about this while Ha­grid read his news­pa­per, the Dai­ly Prophet. Har­ry had learned from Un­cle Ver­non that peo­ple liked to be left alone while they did this, but it was very dif­fi­cult, he’d nev­er had so many ques­tions in his life.

“Min­istry o’ Mag­ic messin’ things up as usu­al,” Ha­grid mut­tered, turn­ing the page.

“There’s a Min­istry of Mag­ic?” Har­ry asked, be­fore he could stop him­self.

“’Course,” said Ha­grid. “They want­ed Dum­ble­dore fer Min­is­ter, o’ course, but he’d nev­er leave Hog­warts, so old Cor­nelius Fudge got the job. Bun­gler if ev­er there was one. So he pelts Dum­ble­dore with owls ev­ery morn­ing, askin’ fer ad­vice.”

“But what does a Min­istry of Mag­ic do?”

“Well, their main job is to keep it from the Mug­gles that there’s still witch­es an’ wiz­ards up an’ down the coun­try.”

“Why?”

“Why? Blimey, Har­ry, ev­ery­one’d be wantin’ mag­ic so­lu­tions to their prob­lems. Nah, we’re best left alone.”

At this mo­ment the boat bumped gen­tly in­to the har­bor wall. Ha­grid fold­ed up his news­pa­per, and they clam­bered up the stone steps on­to the street.

Passers­by stared a lot at Ha­grid as they walked through the lit­tle town to the sta­tion. Har­ry couldn’t blame them. Not on­ly was Ha­grid twice as tall as any­one else, he kept point­ing at per­fect­ly or­di­nary things like park­ing me­ters and say­ing loud­ly, “See that, Har­ry? Things these Mug­gles dream up, eh?”

“Ha­grid,” said Har­ry, pant­ing a bit as he ran to keep up, “did you say there are drag­ons at Gringotts?”

“Well, so they say,” said Ha­grid. “Crikey, I’d like a drag­on.”

“You’d like one?”

“Want­ed one ev­er since I was a kid — here we go.”

They had reached the sta­tion. There was a train to Lon­don in five min­utes’ time. Ha­grid, who didn’t un­der­stand “Mug­gle mon­ey,” as he called it, gave the bills to Har­ry so he could buy their tick­ets.

Peo­ple stared more than ev­er on the train. Ha­grid took up two seats and sat knit­ting what looked like a ca­nary-​yel­low cir­cus tent.

“Still got yer let­ter, Har­ry?” he asked as he count­ed stitch­es.

Har­ry took the parch­ment en­ve­lope out of his pock­et.

“Good,” said Ha­grid. “There’s a list there of ev­ery­thing yeh need.”

Har­ry un­fold­ed a sec­ond piece of pa­per he hadn’t no­ticed the night be­fore, and read:

PAR­ENTS ARE RE­MIND­ED THAT FIRST YEARS ARE NOT AL­LOWED THEIR OWN BROOM­STICKS



“Can we buy all this in Lon­don?” Har­ry won­dered aloud.

“If yeh know where to go,” said Ha­grid.



Har­ry had nev­er been to Lon­don be­fore. Al­though Ha­grid seemed to know where he was go­ing, he was ob­vi­ous­ly not used to get­ting there in an or­di­nary way. He got stuck in the tick­et bar­ri­er on the Un­der­ground, and com­plained loud­ly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow.

“I don’t know how the Mug­gles man­age with­out mag­ic,” he said as they climbed a bro­ken-​down es­ca­la­tor that led up to a bustling road lined with shops.

Ha­grid was so huge that he part­ed the crowd eas­ily; all Har­ry had to do was keep close be­hind him. They passed book shops and mu­sic stores, ham­burg­er restau­rants and cin­emas, but nowhere that looked as if it could sell you a mag­ic wand. This was just an or­di­nary street full of or­di­nary peo­ple. Could there re­al­ly be piles of wiz­ard gold buried miles be­neath them? Were there re­al­ly shops that sold spell books and broom­sticks? Might this not all be some huge joke that the Durs­leys had cooked up? If Har­ry hadn’t known that the Durs­leys had no sense of hu­mor, he might have thought so; yet some­how, even though ev­ery­thing Ha­grid had told him so far was un­be­liev­able, Har­ry couldn’t help trust­ing him.

“This is it,” said Ha­grid, com­ing to a halt, “the Leaky Caul­dron. It’s a fa­mous place.”

It was a tiny, grub­by-​look­ing pub. If Ha­grid hadn’t point­ed it out, Har­ry wouldn’t have no­ticed it was there. The peo­ple hur­ry­ing by didn’t glance at it. Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the oth­er as if they couldn’t see the Leaky Caul­dron at all. In fact, Har­ry had the most pe­cu­liar feel­ing that on­ly he and Ha­grid could see it. Be­fore he could men­tion this, Ha­grid had steered him in­side.

For a fa­mous place, it was very dark and shab­by. A few old wom­en were sit­ting in a cor­ner, drink­ing tiny glass­es of sher­ry. One of them was smok­ing a long pipe. A lit­tle man in a top hat was talk­ing to the old bar­tender, who was quite bald and looked like a tooth­less wal­nut. The low buzz of chat­ter stopped when they walked in. Ev­ery­one seemed to know Ha­grid; they waved and smiled at him, and the bar­tender reached for a glass, say­ing, “The usu­al, Ha­grid?”

“Can’t, Tom, I’m on Hog­warts busi­ness,” said Ha­grid, clap­ping his great hand on Har­ry’s shoul­der and mak­ing Har­ry’s knees buck­le.

“Good Lord,” said the bar­tender, peer­ing at Har­ry, “is this — can this be —?”

The Leaky Caul­dron had sud­den­ly gone com­plete­ly still and silent.

“Bless my soul,” whis­pered the old bar­tender, “Har­ry Pot­ter…what an hon­or.”

He hur­ried out from be­hind the bar, rushed to­ward Har­ry and seized his hand, tears in his eyes.

“Wel­come back, Mr. Pot­ter, wel­come back.”

Har­ry didn’t know what to say. Ev­ery­one was look­ing at him. The old wom­an with the pipe was puff­ing on it with­out re­al­iz­ing it had gone out. Ha­grid was beam­ing.

Then there was a great scrap­ing of chairs and the next mo­ment, Har­ry found him­self shak­ing hands with ev­ery­one in the Leaky Caul­dron.

“Doris Crock­ford, Mr. Pot­ter, can’t be­lieve I’m meet­ing you at last.”

“So proud, Mr. Pot­ter, I’m just so proud.”

“Al­ways want­ed to shake your hand — I’m all of a flut­ter.”

“De­light­ed, Mr. Pot­ter, just can’t tell you, Dig­gle’s the name, Dedalus Dig­gle.”

“I’ve seen you be­fore!” said Har­ry, as Dedalus Dig­gle’s top hat fell off in his ex­cite­ment. “You bowed to me once in a shop.”

“He re­mem­bers!” cried Dedalus Dig­gle, look­ing around at ev­ery­one. “Did you hear that? He re­mem­bers me!” Har­ry shook hands again and again — Doris Crock­ford kept com­ing back for more.

A pale young man made his way for­ward, very ner­vous­ly. One of his eyes was twitch­ing.

“Pro­fes­sor Quir­rell!” said Ha­grid. “Har­ry, Pro­fes­sor Quir­rell will be one of your teach­ers at Hog­warts.”

“P-​P-​Pot­ter,” stam­mered Pro­fes­sor Quir­rell, grasp­ing Har­ry’s hand, “c-​can’t t-​tell you how p-​pleased I am to meet you.”

“What sort of mag­ic do you teach, Pro­fes­sor Quir­rell?”

“D-​De­fense Against the D-​D-​Dark Arts,” mut­tered Pro­fes­sor Quir­rell, as though he’d rather not think about it. “N-​not that you n-​need it, eh, P-​P-​Pot­ter?” He laughed ner­vous­ly. “You’ll be g-​get­ting all your equip­ment, I sup­pose? I’ve g-​got to p-​pick up a new b-​book on vam­pires, m-​my­self.” He looked ter­ri­fied at the very thought.

But the oth­ers wouldn’t let Pro­fes­sor Quir­rell keep Har­ry to him­self. It took al­most ten min­utes to get away from them all. At last, Ha­grid man­aged to make him­self heard over the bab­ble.

“Must get on — lots ter buy. Come on, Har­ry.”

Doris Crock­ford shook Har­ry’s hand one last time, and Ha­grid led them through the bar and out in­to a small, walled court­yard, where there was noth­ing but a trash can and a few weeds.

Ha­grid grinned at Har­ry.

“Told yeh, didn’t I? Told yeh you was fa­mous. Even Pro­fes­sor Quir­rell was trem­blin’ ter meet yeh — mind you, he’s usu­al­ly trem­blin’.”

“Is he al­ways that ner­vous?”

“Oh, yeah. Poor bloke. Bril­liant mind. He was fine while he was studyin’ out­ta books but then he took a year off ter get some first­hand ex­pe­ri­ence....They say he met vam­pires in the Black For­est, and there was a nasty bit o’ trou­ble with a hag — nev­er been the same since. Scared of the stu­dents, scared of his own sub­ject — now, where’s me um­brel­la?”

Vam­pires? Hags? Har­ry’s head was swim­ming. Ha­grid, mean­while, was count­ing bricks in the wall above the trash can.

“Three up…two across…” he mut­tered. “Right, stand back, Har­ry.”

He tapped the wall three times with the point of his um­brel­la.

The brick he had touched quiv­ered — it wrig­gled — in the mid­dle, a small hole ap­peared — it grew wider and wider — a sec­ond lat­er they were fac­ing an arch­way large enough even for Ha­grid, an arch­way on­to a cob­bled street that twist­ed and turned out of sight.

“Wel­come,” said Ha­grid, “to Di­agon Al­ley.”

He grinned at Har­ry’s amaze­ment. They stepped through the arch­way. Har­ry looked quick­ly over his shoul­der and saw the arch­way shrink in­stant­ly back in­to sol­id wall.

The sun shone bright­ly on a stack of caul­drons out­side the near­est shop. Caul­drons — All Sizes — Cop­per, Brass, Pewter, Sil­ver — Self-​Stir­ring — Col­lapsi­ble, said a sign hang­ing over them.

“Yeah, you’ll be need­in’ one,” said Ha­grid, “but we got­ta get yer mon­ey first.”

Har­ry wished he had about eight more eyes. He turned his head in ev­ery di­rec­tion as they walked up the street, try­ing to look at ev­ery­thing at once: the shops, the things out­side them, the peo­ple do­ing their shop­ping. A plump wom­an out­side an Apothe­cary was shak­ing her head as they passed, say­ing, “Drag­on liv­er, sev­en­teen Sick­les an ounce, they’re mad.…”

A low, soft hoot­ing came from a dark shop with a sign say­ing Eey­lops Owl Em­po­ri­um — Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy. Sev­er­al boys of about Har­ry’s age had their noses pressed against a win­dow with broom­sticks in it. “Look,” Har­ry heard one of them say, “the new Nim­bus Two Thou­sand — fastest ev­er —” There were shops sell­ing robes, shops sell­ing tele­scopes and strange sil­ver in­stru­ments Har­ry had nev­er seen be­fore, win­dows stacked with bar­rels of bat spleens and eels’ eyes, tot­ter­ing piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parch­ment, po­tion bot­tles, globes of the moon.…

“Gringotts,” said Ha­grid.

They had reached a snowy white build­ing that tow­ered over the oth­er lit­tle shops. Stand­ing be­side its bur­nished bronze doors, wear­ing a uni­form of scar­let and gold, was —

“Yeah, that’s a gob­lin,” said Ha­grid qui­et­ly as they walked up the white stone steps to­ward him. The gob­lin was about a head short­er than Har­ry. He had a swarthy, clever face, a point­ed beard and, Har­ry no­ticed, very long fin­gers and feet. He bowed as they walked in­side. Now they were fac­ing a sec­ond pair of doors, sil­ver this time, with words en­graved up­on them:

En­ter, stranger, but take heed

Of what awaits the sin of greed,

For those who take, but do not earn,

Must pay most dear­ly in their turn.

So if you seek be­neath our floors

A trea­sure that was nev­er yours,

Thief, you have been warned, be­ware

Of find­ing more than trea­sure there.



“Like I said, Yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it,” said Ha­grid.

A pair of gob­lins bowed them through the sil­ver doors and they were in a vast mar­ble hall. About a hun­dred more gob­lins were sit­ting on high stools be­hind a long counter, scrib­bling in large ledgers, weigh­ing coins in brass scales, ex­am­in­ing pre­cious stones through eye­glass­es. There were too many doors to count lead­ing off the hall, and yet more gob­lins were show­ing peo­ple in and out of these. Ha­grid and Har­ry made for the counter.

“Morn­ing,” said Ha­grid to a free gob­lin. “We’ve come ter take some mon­ey out­ta Mr. Har­ry Pot­ter’s safe.”

“You have his key, sir?”

“Got it here some­where,” said Ha­grid, and he start­ed emp­ty­ing his pock­ets on­to the counter, scat­ter­ing a hand­ful of moldy dog bis­cuits over the gob­lin’s book of num­bers. The gob­lin wrin­kled his nose. Har­ry watched the gob­lin on their right weigh­ing a pile of ru­bies as big as glow­ing coals.

“Got it,” said Ha­grid at last, hold­ing up a tiny gold­en key.

The gob­lin looked at it close­ly.

“That seems to be in or­der.”

“An’ I’ve al­so got a let­ter here from Pro­fes­sor Dum­ble­dore,” said Ha­grid im­por­tant­ly, throw­ing out his chest. “It’s about the You-​Know-​What in vault sev­en hun­dred and thir­teen.”

The gob­lin read the let­ter care­ful­ly.

“Very well,” he said, hand­ing it back to Ha­grid, “I will have some­one take you down to both vaults. Griphook!”

Griphook was yet an­oth­er gob­lin. Once Ha­grid had crammed all the dog bis­cuits back in­side his pock­ets, he and Har­ry fol­lowed Griphook to­ward one of the doors lead­ing off the hall.

“What’s the You-​Know-​What in vault sev­en hun­dred and thir­teen?” Har­ry asked.

“Can’t tell yeh that,” said Ha­grid mys­te­ri­ous­ly. “Very se­cret. Hog­warts busi­ness. Dum­ble­dore’s trust­ed me. More’n my job’s worth ter tell yeh that.”

Griphook held the door open for them. Har­ry, who had ex­pect­ed more mar­ble, was sur­prised. They were in a nar­row stone pas­sage­way lit with flam­ing torch­es. It sloped steeply down­ward and there were lit­tle rail­way tracks on the floor. Griphook whis­tled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks to­ward them. They climbed in — Ha­grid with some dif­fi­cul­ty — and were off.

At first they just hur­tled through a maze of twist­ing pas­sages. Har­ry tried to re­mem­ber, left, right, right, left, mid­dle fork, right, left, but it was im­pos­si­ble. The rat­tling cart seemed to know its own way, be­cause Griphook wasn’t steer­ing.

Har­ry’s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them wide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a pas­sage and twist­ed around to see if it was a drag­on, but too late — they plunged even deep­er, pass­ing an un­der­ground lake where huge sta­lac­tites and sta­lag­mites grew from the ceil­ing and floor.

“I nev­er know,” Har­ry called to Ha­grid over the noise of the cart, “what’s the dif­fer­ence be­tween a sta­lag­mite and a sta­lac­tite?”

“Sta­lag­mite’s got an ‘m’ in it,” said Ha­grid. “An’ don’ ask me ques­tions just now, I think I’m gonna be sick.”

He did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last be­side a small door in the pas­sage wall, Ha­grid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from trem­bling.

Griphook un­locked the door. A lot of green smoke came bil­low­ing out, and as it cleared, Har­ry gasped. In­side were mounds of gold coins. Columns of sil­ver. Heaps of lit­tle bronze Knuts.

“All yours,” smiled Ha­grid.

All Har­ry’s — it was in­cred­ible. The Durs­leys couldn’t have known about this or they’d have had it from him faster than blink­ing. How of­ten had they com­plained how much Har­ry cost them to keep? And all the time there had been a small for­tune be­long­ing to him, buried deep un­der Lon­don.

Ha­grid helped Har­ry pile some of it in­to a bag.

“The gold ones are Galleons,” he ex­plained. “Sev­en­teen sil­ver Sick­les to a Galleon and twen­ty-​nine Knuts to a Sick­le, it’s easy enough. Right, that should be enough fer a cou­ple o’ terms, we’ll keep the rest safe for yeh.” He turned to Griphook. “Vault sev­en hun­dred and thir­teen now, please, and can we go more slow­ly?”

“One speed on­ly,” said Griphook.

They were go­ing even deep­er now and gath­er­ing speed. The air be­came cold­er and cold­er as they hur­tled round tight cor­ners. They went rat­tling over an un­der­ground ravine, and Har­ry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bot­tom, but Ha­grid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck.

Vault sev­en hun­dred and thir­teen had no key­hole.

“Stand back,” said Griphook im­por­tant­ly. He stroked the door gen­tly with one of his long fin­gers and it sim­ply melt­ed away.

“If any­one but a Gringotts gob­lin tried that, they’d be sucked through the door and trapped in there,” said Griphook.

“How of­ten do you check to see if any­one’s in­side?” Har­ry asked.

“About once ev­ery ten years,” said Griphook with a rather nasty grin.

Some­thing re­al­ly ex­traor­di­nary had to be in­side this top se­cu­ri­ty vault, Har­ry was sure, and he leaned for­ward ea­ger­ly, ex­pect­ing to see fab­ulous jew­els at the very least — but at first he thought it was emp­ty. Then he no­ticed a grub­by lit­tle pack­age wrapped up in brown pa­per ly­ing on the floor. Ha­grid picked it up and tucked it deep in­side his coat. Har­ry longed to know what it was, but knew bet­ter than to ask.

“Come on, back in this in­fer­nal cart, and don’t talk to me on the way back, it’s best if I keep me mouth shut,” said Ha­grid.



One wild cart ride lat­er they stood blink­ing in the sun­light out­side Gringotts. Har­ry didn’t know where to run first now that he had a bag full of mon­ey. He didn’t have to know how many Galleons there were to a pound to know that he was hold­ing more mon­ey than he’d had in his whole life — more mon­ey than even Dud­ley had ev­er had.

“Might as well get yer uni­form,” said Ha­grid, nod­ding to­ward Madam Malkin’s Robes for All Oc­ca­sions. “Lis­ten, Har­ry, would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a pick-​me-​up in the Leaky Caul­dron? I hate them Gringotts carts.” He did still look a bit sick, so Har­ry en­tered Madam Malkin’s shop alone, feel­ing ner­vous.

Madam Malkin was a squat, smil­ing witch dressed all in mauve.

“Hog­warts, dear?” she said, when Har­ry start­ed to speak. “Got the lot here — an­oth­er young man be­ing fit­ted up just now, in fact.”

In the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, point­ed face was stand­ing on a foot­stool while a sec­ond witch pinned up his long black robes. Madam Malkin stood Har­ry on a stool next to him slipped a long robe over his head, and be­gan to pin it to the right length.

“Hel­lo,” said the boy, “Hog­warts, too?”

“Yes,” said Har­ry.

“My fa­ther’s next door buy­ing my books and moth­er’s up the street look­ing at wands,” said the boy. He had a bored, drawl­ing voice. “Then I’m go­ing to drag them off to took at rac­ing brooms. I don’t see why first years can’t have their own. I think I’ll bul­ly fa­ther in­to get­ting me one and I’ll smug­gle it in some­how.”

Har­ry was strong­ly re­mind­ed of Dud­ley.

“Have you got your own broom?” the boy went on.

“No,” said Har­ry.

“Play Quid­ditch at all?”

“No,” Har­ry said again, won­der­ing what on earth Quid­ditch could be.

“I do — Fa­ther says it’s a crime if I’m not picked to play for my house, and I must say, I agree. Know what house you’ll be in yet?”

“No,” said Har­ry, feel­ing more stupid by the minute.

“Well, no one re­al­ly knows un­til they get there, do they, but I know I’ll be in Slytherin, all our fam­ily have been — imag­ine be­ing in Huf­flepuff, I think I’d leave, wouldn’t you?”

“Mmm,” said Har­ry, wish­ing he could say some­thing a bit more in­ter­est­ing.

“I say, look at that man!” said the boy sud­den­ly, nod­ding to­ward the front win­dow. Ha­grid was stand­ing there, grin­ning at Har­ry and point­ing at two large ice creams to show he couldn’t come in.

“That’s Ha­grid,” said Har­ry, pleased to know some­thing the boy didn’t. “He works at Hog­warts.”

“Oh,” said the boy, “I’ve heard of him. He’s a sort of ser­vant, isn’t he?”

“He’s the game­keep­er,” said Har­ry. He was lik­ing the boy less and less ev­ery sec­ond.

“Yes, ex­act­ly. I heard he’s a sort of sav­age — lives in a hut on the school grounds and ev­ery now and then he gets drunk, tries to do mag­ic, and ends up set­ting fire to his bed.”

“I think he’s bril­liant,” said Har­ry cold­ly.

“Do you?” said the boy, with a slight sneer. “Why is he with you? Where are your par­ents?”

“They’re dead,” said Har­ry short­ly. He didn’t feel much like go­ing in­to the mat­ter with this boy.

“Oh, sor­ry,” said the oth­er, not sound­ing sor­ry at all. “But they were our kind, weren’t they?”

“They were a witch and wiz­ard, if that’s what you mean.”

“I re­al­ly don’t think they should let the oth­er sort in, do you? They’re just not the same, they’ve nev­er been brought up to know our ways. Some of them have nev­er even heard of Hog­warts un­til they get the let­ter, imag­ine. I think they should keep it in the old wiz­ard­ing fam­ilies. What’s your sur­name, any­way?”

But be­fore Har­ry could an­swer, Madam Malkin said, “That’s you done, my dear,” and Har­ry, not sor­ry for an ex­cuse to stop talk­ing to the boy, hopped down from the foot­stool.

“Well, I’ll see you at Hog­warts, I sup­pose,” said the drawl­ing boy.

Har­ry was rather qui­et as he ate the ice cream Ha­grid had bought him (choco­late and rasp­ber­ry with chopped nuts).

“What’s up?” said Ha­grid.

“Noth­ing,” Har­ry lied. They stopped to buy parch­ment and quills. Har­ry cheered up a bit when he found a bot­tle of ink that changed col­or as you wrote. When they had left the shop, he said, “Ha­grid, what’s Quid­ditch?”

“Blimey, Har­ry, I keep for­get­tin’ how lit­tle yeh know — not knowin’ about Quid­ditch!”

“Don’t make me feel worse,” said Har­ry. He told Ha­grid about the pale boy in Madam Malkin’s.

“— and he said peo­ple from Mug­gle fam­ilies shouldn’t even be al­lowed in —”

“Yer not from a Mug­gle fam­ily. If he’d known who yeh were — he’s grown up knowin’ yer name if his par­ents are wiz­ardin’ folk. You saw what ev­ery­one in the Leaky Caul­dron was like when they saw yeh. Any­way, what does he know about it, some o’ the best I ev­er saw were the on­ly ones with mag­ic in ‘em in a long line o’ Mug­gles — look at yer mum! Look what she had fer a sis­ter!”

“So what is Quid­ditch?”

“It’s our sport. Wiz­ard sport. It’s like — like soc­cer in the Mug­gle world — ev­ery­one fol­lows Quid­ditch — played up in the air on broom­sticks and there’s four balls — sor­ta hard ter ex­plain the rules.”

“And what are Slytherin and Huf­flepuff?”

“School hous­es. There’s four. Ev­ery­one says Huf­flepuff are a lot o’ duf­fers, but —”

“I bet I’m in Huf­flepuff,” said Har­ry gloomi­ly.

“Bet­ter Huf­flepuff than Slytherin,” said Ha­grid dark­ly. “There’s not a sin­gle witch or wiz­ard who went bad who wasn’t in Slytherin. You-​Know-​Who was one.”

“Vol-, sor­ry —You-​Know-​Who was at Hog­warts?”

“Years an’ years ago,” said Ha­grid.

They bought Har­ry’s school books in a shop called Flour­ish and Blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceil­ing with books as large as paving stones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in cov­ers of silk; books full of pe­cu­liar sym­bols and a few books with noth­ing in them at all. Even Dud­ley, who nev­er read any­thing, would have been wild to get his hands on some of these. Ha­grid al­most had to drag Har­ry away from Curs­es and Coun­ter­curs­es (Be­witch Your Friends and Be­fud­dle Your En­emies with the Lat­est Re­venges: Hair Loss, Jel­ly-​Legs, Tongue-​Ty­ing and Much, Much More) by Pro­fes­sor Vin­dic­tus Virid­ian.

“I was try­ing to find out how to curse Dud­ley.”

“I’m not sayin’ that’s not a good idea, but yer not ter use mag­ic in the Mug­gle world ex­cept in very spe­cial cir­cum­stances,” said Ha­grid. “An’ any­way, yeh couldn’ work any of them curs­es yet, yeh’ll need a lot more study be­fore yeh get ter that lev­el.”

Ha­grid wouldn’t let Har­ry buy a sol­id gold caul­dron, ei­ther (“It says pewter on yer list”), but they got a nice set of scales for weigh­ing po­tion in­gre­di­ents and a col­lapsi­ble brass tele­scope. Then they vis­it­ed the Apothe­cary, which was fas­ci­nat­ing enough to make up for its hor­ri­ble smell, a mix­ture of bad eggs and rot­ted cab­bages. Bar­rels of slimy stuff stood on the floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright pow­ders lined the walls; bun­dles of feath­ers, strings of fangs, and snarled claws hung from the ceil­ing. While Ha­grid asked the man be­hind the counter for a sup­ply of some ba­sic po­tion in­gre­di­ents for Har­ry, Har­ry him­self ex­am­ined sil­ver uni­corn horns at twen­ty-​one Galleons each and mi­nus­cule, glit­tery-​black bee­tle eyes (five Knuts a scoop).

Out­side the Apothe­cary, Ha­grid checked Har­ry’s list again.

“Just yer wand left — A yeah, an’ I still haven’t got yeh a birth­day present.”

Har­ry felt him­self go red.

“You don’t have to —”

“I know I don’t have to. Tell yeh what, I’ll get yer an­imal. Not a toad, toads went out­ta fash­ion years ago, yeh’d be laughed at — an’ I don’ like cats, they make me sneeze. I’ll get yer an owl. All the kids want owls, they’re dead use­ful, car­ry yer mail an’ ev­ery­thin’.”

Twen­ty min­utes lat­er, they left Eey­lops Owl Em­po­ri­um, which had been dark and full of rustling and flick­er­ing, jew­el-​bright eyes. Har­ry now car­ried a large cage that held a beau­ti­ful snowy owl, fast asleep with her head un­der her wing. He couldn’t stop stam­mer­ing his thanks, sound­ing just like Pro­fes­sor Quir­rell.

“Don’ men­tion it,” said Ha­grid gruffly. “Don’ ex­pect you’ve had a lot­ta presents from them Durs­leys. Just Ol­li­van­ders left now — on­ly place fer wands, Ol­li­van­ders, and yeh got­ta have the best wand.”

A mag­ic wand…this was what Har­ry had been re­al­ly look­ing for­ward to.

The last shop was nar­row and shab­by. Peel­ing gold let­ters over the door read Ol­li­van­ders: Mak­ers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. A sin­gle wand lay on a fad­ed pur­ple cush­ion in the dusty win­dow.

A tin­kling bell rang some­where in the depths of the shop as they stepped in­side. It was a tiny place, emp­ty ex­cept for a sin­gle, spindly chair that Ha­grid sat on to wait. Har­ry felt strange­ly as though he had en­tered a very strict li­brary; he swal­lowed a lot of new ques­tions that had just oc­curred to him and looked in­stead at the thou­sands of nar­row box­es piled neat­ly right up to the ceil­ing. For some rea­son, the back of his neck prick­led. The very dust and si­lence in here seemed to tin­gle with some se­cret mag­ic.

“Good af­ter­noon,” said a soft voice. Har­ry jumped. Ha­grid must have jumped, too, be­cause there was a loud crunch­ing noise and he got quick­ly off the spindly chair.

An old man was stand­ing be­fore them, his wide, pale eyes shin­ing like moons through the gloom of the shop.

“Hel­lo,” said Har­ry awk­ward­ly.

“Ah yes,” said the man. “Yes, yes. I thought I’d be see­ing you soon. Har­ry Pot­ter.” It wasn’t a ques­tion. “You have your moth­er’s eyes. It seems on­ly yes­ter­day she was in here her­self, buy­ing her first wand. Ten and a quar­ter inch­es long, swishy, made of wil­low. Nice wand for charm work.”

Mr. Ol­li­van­der moved clos­er to Har­ry. Har­ry wished he would blink. Those sil­very eyes were a bit creepy.

“Your fa­ther, on the oth­er hand, fa­vored a ma­hogany wand. Eleven inch­es. Pli­able. A lit­tle more pow­er and ex­cel­lent for trans­fig­ura­tion. Well, I say your fa­ther fa­vored it — it’s re­al­ly the wand that choos­es the wiz­ard, of course.”

Mr. Ol­li­van­der had come so close that he and Har­ry were al­most nose to nose. Har­ry could see him­self re­flect­ed in those misty eyes.

“And that’s where…”

Mr. Ol­li­van­der touched the light­ning scar on Har­ry’s fore­head with a long, white fin­ger.

“I’m sor­ry to say I sold the wand that did it,” he said soft­ly. “Thir­teen-​and-​a-​half inch­es. Yew. Pow­er­ful wand, very pow­er­ful, and in the wrong hands…well, if I’d known what that wand was go­ing out in­to the world to do.…”

He shook his head and then, to Har­ry’s re­lief, spot­ted Ha­grid.

“Rubeus! Rubeus Ha­grid! How nice to see you again.…Oak, six­teen inch­es, rather bendy, wasn’t it?”

“It was, sir, yes,” said Ha­grid.

“Good wand, that one. But I sup­pose they snapped it in half when you got ex­pelled?” said Mr. Ol­li­van­der, sud­den­ly stern.

“Er — yes, they did, yes,” said Ha­grid, shuf­fling his feet. “I’ve still got the pieces, though,” he added bright­ly.

“But you don’t use them?” said Mr. Ol­li­van­der sharply.

“Oh, no, sir,” said Ha­grid quick­ly. Har­ry no­ticed he gripped his pink um­brel­la very tight­ly as he spoke.

“Hm­mm,” said Mr. Ol­li­van­der, giv­ing Ha­grid a pierc­ing look. “Well, now — Mr. Pot­ter. Let me see.” He pulled a long tape mea­sure with sil­ver mark­ings out of his pock­et. “Which is your wand arm?”

“Er — well, I’m right-​hand­ed,” said Har­ry.

“Hold out your arm. That’s it.” He mea­sured Har­ry from shoul­der to fin­ger, then wrist to el­bow, shoul­der to floor, knee to armpit and round his head. As he mea­sured, he said, “Ev­ery Ol­li­van­der wand has a core of a pow­er­ful mag­ical sub­stance, Mr. Pot­ter. We use uni­corn hairs, phoenix tail feath­ers, and the heart­strings of drag­ons. No two Ol­li­van­der wands are the same, just as no two uni­corns, drag­ons, or phoenix­es are quite the same. And of course, you will nev­er get such good re­sults with an­oth­er wiz­ard’s wand.”

Har­ry sud­den­ly re­al­ized that the tape mea­sure, which was mea­sur­ing be­tween his nos­trils, was do­ing this on its own. Mr. Ol­li­van­der was flit­ting around the shelves, tak­ing down box­es.

“That will do,” he said, and the tape mea­sure crum­pled in­to a heap on the floor. “Right then, Mr. Pot­ter. Try this one. Beech­wood and drag­on heart­string. Nine inch­es. Nice and flex­ible. just take it and give it a wave.”

Har­ry took the wand and (feel­ing fool­ish) waved it around a bit, but Mr. Ol­li­van­der snatched it out of his hand al­most at once.

“Maple and phoenix feath­er. Sev­en inch­es. Quite whip­py. Try —”

Har­ry tried — but he had hard­ly raised the wand when it, too, was snatched back by Mr. Ol­li­van­der.

“No, no — here, ebony and uni­corn hair, eight and a half inch­es, springy. Go on, go on, try it out.”

Har­ry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr. Ol­li­van­der was wait­ing for. The pile of tried wands was mount­ing high­er and high­er on the spindly chair, but the more wands Mr. Ol­li­van­der pulled from the shelves, the hap­pi­er he seemed to be­come.

“Tricky cus­tomer, eh? Not to wor­ry, we’ll find the per­fect match here some­where — I won­der, now — yes, why not — un­usu­al com­bi­na­tion — hol­ly and phoenix feath­er, eleven inch­es, nice and sup­ple.”

Har­ry took the wand. He felt a sud­den warmth in his fin­gers. He raised the wand above his head, brought it swish­ing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a fire­work, throw­ing danc­ing spots of light on to the walls. Ha­grid whooped and clapped and Mr. Ol­li­van­der cried, “Oh, bra­vo! Yes, in­deed, oh, very good. Well, well, well…how cu­ri­ous…how very cu­ri­ous…”

He put Har­ry’s wand back in­to its box and wrapped it in brown pa­per, still mut­ter­ing, “Cu­ri­ous…cu­ri­ous…

“Sor­ry,” said Har­ry, “but what’s cu­ri­ous?”

Mr. Ol­li­van­der fixed Har­ry with his pale stare.

“I re­mem­ber ev­ery wand I’ve ev­er sold, Mr. Pot­ter. Ev­ery sin­gle wand. It so hap­pens that the phoenix whose tail feath­er is in your wand, gave an­oth­er feath­er — just one oth­er. It is very cu­ri­ous in­deed that you should be des­tined for this wand when its broth­er — why, its broth­er gave you that scar.”

Har­ry swal­lowed.

“Yes, thir­teen-​and-​a-​half inch­es. Yew. Cu­ri­ous in­deed how these things hap­pen. The wand choos­es the wiz­ard, re­mem­ber…I think we must ex­pect great things from you, Mr. Pot­ter….Af­ter all, He-​Who-​Must-​Not-​Be-​Named did great things — ter­ri­ble, yes, but great.”

Har­ry shiv­ered. He wasn’t sure he liked Mr. Ol­li­van­der too much. He paid sev­en gold Galleons for his wand, and Mr. Ol­li­van­der bowed them from his shop.



The late af­ter­noon sun hung low in the sky as Har­ry and Ha­grid made their way back down Di­agon Al­ley, back through the wall, back through the Leaky Caul­dron, now emp­ty. Har­ry didn’t speak at all as they walked down the road; he didn’t even no­tice how much peo­ple were gawk­ing at them on the Un­der­ground, laden as they were with all their fun­ny-​shaped pack­ages, with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on Har­ry’s lap. Up an­oth­er es­ca­la­tor, out in­to Padding­ton sta­tion; Har­ry on­ly re­al­ized where they were when Ha­grid tapped him on the shoul­der.

“Got time fer a bite to eat be­fore yer train leaves,” he said.

He bought Har­ry a ham­burg­er and they sat down on plas­tic seats to eat them. Har­ry kept look­ing around. Ev­ery­thing looked so strange, some­how.

“You all right, Har­ry? Yer very qui­et,” said Ha­grid.

Har­ry wasn’t sure he could ex­plain. He’d just had the best birth­day of his life — and yet — he chewed his ham­burg­er, try­ing to find the words.

“Ev­ery­one thinks I’m spe­cial,” he said at last. “All those peo­ple in the Leaky Caul­dron, Pro­fes­sor Quir­rell, Mr. Ol­li­van­der…but I don’t know any­thing about mag­ic at all. How can they ex­pect great things? I’m fa­mous and I can’t even re­mem­ber what I’m fa­mous for. I don’t know what hap­pened when Vol-, sor­ry — I mean, the night my par­ents died.”

Ha­grid leaned across the ta­ble. Be­hind the wild beard and eye­brows he wore a very kind smile.

“Don’ you wor­ry, Har­ry. You’ll learn fast enough. Ev­ery­one starts at the be­gin­ning at Hog­warts, you’ll be just fine. Just be yer­self. I know it’s hard. Yeh’ve been sin­gled out, an’ that’s al­ways hard. But yeh’ll have a great time at Hog­warts — I did — still do, ’smat­ter of fact.”

Ha­grid helped Har­ry on to the train that would take him back to the Durs­leys, then hand­ed him an en­ve­lope.

“Yer tick­et fer Hog­warts, “ he said. “First o’ Septem­ber — King’s Cross — it’s all on yer tick­et. Any prob­lems with the Durs­leys, send me a let­ter with yer owl, she’ll know where to find me….See yeh soon, Har­ry.”

The train pulled out of the sta­tion. Har­ry want­ed to watch Ha­grid un­til he was out of sight; he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against the win­dow, but he blinked and Ha­grid had gone.

CHAPTER SIX




THE JOUR­NEY FROM PLAT­FORM NINE AND THREE-​QUAR­TERS



H ar­ry’s last month with the Durs­leys wasn’t fun. True, Dud­ley was now so scared of Har­ry he wouldn’t stay in the same room, while Aunt Petu­nia and Un­cle Ver­non didn’t shut Har­ry in his cup­board, force him to do any­thing, or shout at him — in fact, they didn’t speak to him at all. Half ter­ri­fied, half fu­ri­ous, they act­ed as though any chair with Har­ry in it were emp­ty. Al­though this was an im­prove­ment in many ways, it did be­come a bit de­press­ing af­ter a while.

Har­ry kept to his room, with his new owl for com­pa­ny. He had de­cid­ed to call her Hed­wig, a name he had found in A His­to­ry of Mag­ic. His school books were very in­ter­est­ing. He lay on his bed read­ing late in­to the night, Hed­wig swoop­ing in and out of the open win­dow as she pleased. It was lucky that Aunt Petu­nia didn’t come in to vac­uum any­more, be­cause Hed­wig kept bring­ing back dead mice. Ev­ery night be­fore he went to sleep, Har­ry ticked off an­oth­er day on the piece of pa­per he had pinned to the wall, count­ing down to Septem­ber the first.

On the last day of Au­gust he thought he’d bet­ter speak to his aunt and un­cle about get­ting to King’s Cross sta­tion the next day, so he went down to the liv­ing room where they were watch­ing a quiz show on tele­vi­sion. He cleared his throat to let them know he was there, and Dud­ley screamed and ran from the room.

“Er — Un­cle Ver­non?”

Un­cle Ver­non grunt­ed to show he was lis­ten­ing.

“Er — I need to be at King’s Cross to­mor­row to — to go to Hog­warts.”

Un­cle Ver­non grunt­ed again.

“Would it be all right if you gave me a lift?”

Grunt. Har­ry sup­posed that meant yes.

“Thank you.”

He was about to go back up­stairs when Un­cle Ver­non ac­tu­al­ly spoke.

“Fun­ny way to get to a wiz­ards’ school, the train. Mag­ic car­pets all got punc­tures, have they?”

Har­ry didn’t say any­thing.

“Where is this school, any­way?”

“I don’t know,” said Har­ry, re­al­iz­ing this for the first time. He pulled the tick­et Ha­grid had giv­en him out of his pock­et.

“I just take the train from plat­form nine and three-​quar­ters at eleven o’clock,” he read.

His aunt and un­cle stared.

“Plat­form what?”

“Nine and three-​quar­ters.”

“Don’t talk rub­bish,” said Un­cle Ver­non. “There is no plat­form nine and three-​quar­ters.”

“It’s on my tick­et.”

“Bark­ing,” said Un­cle Ver­non, “howl­ing mad, the lot of them. You’ll see. You just wait. All right, we’ll take you to King’s Cross. We’re go­ing up to Lon­don to­mor­row any­way, or I wouldn’t both­er.”

“Why are you go­ing to Lon­don?” Har­ry asked, try­ing to keep things friend­ly.

“Tak­ing Dud­ley to the hos­pi­tal,” growled Un­cle Ver­non. “Got to have that rud­dy tail re­moved be­fore he goes to Smelt­ings.”



Har­ry woke at five o’clock the next morn­ing and was too ex­cit­ed and ner­vous to go back to sleep. He got up and pulled on his jeans be­cause he didn’t want to walk in­to the sta­tion in his wiz­ard’s robes — he’d change on the train. He checked his Hog­warts list yet again to make sure he had ev­ery­thing he need­ed, saw that Hed­wig was shut safe­ly in her cage, and then paced the room, wait­ing for the Durs­leys to get up. Two hours lat­er, Har­ry’s huge, heavy trunk had been load­ed in­to the Durs­leys’ car, Aunt Petu­nia had talked Dud­ley in­to sit­ting next to Har­ry, and they had set off.

They reached King’s Cross at half past ten. Un­cle Ver­non dumped Har­ry’s trunk on­to a cart and wheeled it in­to the sta­tion for him. Har­ry thought this was strange­ly kind un­til Un­cle Ver­non stopped dead, fac­ing the plat­forms with a nasty grin on his face.

“Well, there you are, boy. Plat­form nine — plat­form ten. Your plat­form should be some­where in the mid­dle, but they don’t seem to have built it yet, do they?”

He was quite right, of course. There was a big plas­tic num­ber nine over one plat­form and a big plas­tic num­ber ten over the one next to it, and in the mid­dle, noth­ing at all.

“Have a good term,” said Un­cle Ver­non with an even nas­ti­er smile. He left with­out an­oth­er word. Har­ry turned and saw the Durs­leys drive away. All three of them were laugh­ing. Har­ry’s mouth went rather dry. What on earth was he go­ing to do? He was start­ing to at­tract a lot of fun­ny looks, be­cause of Hed­wig. He’d have to ask some­one.

He stopped a pass­ing guard, but didn’t dare men­tion plat­form nine and three-​quar­ters. The guard had nev­er heard of Hog­warts and when Har­ry couldn’t even tell him what part of the coun­try it was in, he start­ed to get an­noyed, as though Har­ry was be­ing stupid on pur­pose. Get­ting des­per­ate, Har­ry asked for the train that left at eleven o’clock, but the guard said there wasn’t one. In the end the guard strode away, mut­ter­ing about time wasters. Har­ry was now try­ing hard not to pan­ic. Ac­cord­ing to the large clock over the ar­rivals board, he had ten min­utes left to get on the train to Hog­warts and he had no idea how to do it; he was strand­ed in the mid­dle of a sta­tion with a trunk he could hard­ly lift, a pock­et full of wiz­ard mon­ey, and a large owl.

Ha­grid must have for­got­ten to tell him some­thing you had to do, like tap­ping the third brick on the left to get in­to Di­agon Al­ley. He won­dered if he should get out his wand and start tap­ping the tick­et in­spec­tor’s stand be­tween plat­forms nine and ten.

At that mo­ment a group of peo­ple passed just be­hind him and he caught a few words of what they were say­ing.

“— packed with Mug­gles, of course —”

Har­ry swung round. The speak­er was a plump wom­an who was talk­ing to four boys, all with flam­ing red hair. Each of them was push­ing a trunk like Har­ry’s in front of him — and they had an owl.

Heart ham­mer­ing, Har­ry pushed his cart af­ter them. They stopped and so did he, just near enough to hear what they were say­ing.

“Now, what’s the plat­form num­ber?” said the boys’ moth­er.

“Nine and three-​quar­ters!” piped a small girl, al­so red-​head­ed, who was hold­ing her hand, “Mom, can’t I go…”

“You’re not old enough, Gin­ny, now be qui­et. All right, Per­cy, you go first.”

What looked like the old­est boy marched to­ward plat­forms nine and ten. Har­ry watched, care­ful not to blink in case he missed it — but just as the boy reached the di­vid­ing bar­ri­er be­tween the two plat­forms, a large crowd of tourists came swarm­ing in front of him and by the time the last back­pack had cleared away, the boy had van­ished.

“Fred, you next,” the plump wom­an said.

“I’m not Fred, I’m George,” said the boy. “Hon­est­ly, wom­an, you call your­self our moth­er? Can’t you tell I’m George?”

“Sor­ry, George, dear.”

“On­ly jok­ing, I am Fred,” said the boy, and off he went. His twin called af­ter him to hur­ry up, and he must have done so, be­cause a sec­ond lat­er, he had gone — but how had he done it?

Now the third broth­er was walk­ing briskly to­ward the bar­ri­er he was al­most there — and then, quite sud­den­ly, he wasn’t any­where.

There was noth­ing else for it.

“Ex­cuse me,” Har­ry said to the plump wom­an.

“Hel­lo, dear,” she said. “First time at Hog­warts? Ron’s new, too.”

She point­ed at the last and youngest of her sons. He was tall, thin, and gan­gling, with freck­les, big hands and feet, and a long nose.

“Yes,” said Har­ry. “The thing is — the thing is, I don’t know how to —”

“How to get on­to the plat­form?” she said kind­ly, and Har­ry nod­ded.

“Not to wor­ry,” she said. “All you have to do is walk straight at the bar­ri­er be­tween plat­forms nine and ten. Don’t stop and don’t be scared you’ll crash in­to it, that’s very im­por­tant. Best do it at a bit of a run if you’re ner­vous. Go on, go now be­fore Ron.”

“Er — okay,” said Har­ry.

He pushed his trol­ley around and stared at the bar­ri­er. It looked very sol­id.

He start­ed to walk to­ward it. Peo­ple jos­tled him on their way to plat­forms nine and ten. Har­ry walked more quick­ly. He was go­ing to smash right in­to that bar­ri­er and then he’d be in trou­ble — lean­ing for­ward on his cart, he broke in­to a heavy run — the bar­ri­er was com­ing near­er and near­er — he wouldn’t be able to stop — the cart was out of con­trol — he was a foot away — he closed his eyes ready for the crash —

It didn’t come…he kept on run­ning…he opened his eyes. A scar­let steam en­gine was wait­ing next to a plat­form packed with peo­ple. A sign over­head said Hog­warts’ Ex­press, eleven o’clock. Har­ry looked be­hind him and saw a wrought-​iron arch­way where the bar­ri­er had been, with the words Plat­form Nine and Three-​Quar­ters on it, He had done it.

Smoke from the en­gine drift­ed over the heads of the chat­ter­ing crowd, while cats of ev­ery col­or wound here and there be­tween their legs. Owls hoot­ed to one an­oth­er in a dis­grun­tled sort of way over the bab­ble and the scrap­ing of heavy trunks.

The first few car­riages were al­ready packed with stu­dents, some hang­ing out of the win­dow to talk to their fam­ilies, some fight­ing over seats. Har­ry pushed his cart off down the plat­form in search of an emp­ty seat. He passed a round-​faced boy who was say­ing, “Gran, I’ve lost my toad again.”

“Oh, Neville,” he heard the old wom­an sigh.

A boy with dread­locks was sur­round­ed by a small crowd.

“Give us a look, Lee, go on.”

The boy lift­ed the lid of a box in his arms, and the peo­ple around him shrieked and yelled as some­thing in­side poked out a long, hairy leg.

Har­ry pressed on through the crowd un­til he found an emp­ty com­part­ment near the end of the train. He put Hed­wig in­side first and then start­ed to shove and heave his trunk to­ward the train door. He tried to lift it up the steps but could hard­ly raise one end and twice he dropped it painful­ly on his foot.

“Want a hand?” It was one of the red-​haired twins he’d fol­lowed through the bar­ri­er.

“Yes, please,” Har­ry pant­ed.

“Oy, Fred! C’mere and help!”

With the twins’ help, Har­ry’s trunk was at last tucked away in a cor­ner of the com­part­ment.

“Thanks,” said Har­ry, push­ing his sweaty hair out of his eyes.

“What’s that?” said one of the twins sud­den­ly, point­ing at Har­ry’s light­ning scar.

“Blimey,” said the oth­er twin. “Are you —?”

“He is,” said the first twin. “Aren’t you?” he added to Har­ry.

“What?” said Har­ry.

“Har­ry Pot­ter.” cho­rused the twins.

“Oh, him,” said Har­ry. “I mean, yes, I am.”

The two boys gawked at him, and Har­ry felt him­self turn­ing red. Then, to his re­lief, a voice came float­ing in through the train’s open door.

“Fred? George? Are you there?”

“Com­ing, Mom.”

With a last look at Har­ry, the twins hopped off the train.

Har­ry sat down next to the win­dow where, half hid­den, he could watch the red-​haired fam­ily on the plat­form and hear what they were say­ing. Their moth­er had just tak­en out her hand­ker­chief.

“Ron, you’ve got some­thing on your nose.”

The youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she grabbed him and be­gan rub­bing the end of his nose.

“Mom — geroff” He wrig­gled free.

“Aaah, has ick­le Ron­nie got somefink on his nosie?” said one of the twins.

“Shut up,” said Ron.

“Where’s Per­cy?” said their moth­er.

“He’s com­ing now.”

The old­est boy came strid­ing in­to sight. He had al­ready changed in­to his bil­low­ing black Hog­warts robes, and Har­ry no­ticed a shiny sil­ver badge on his chest with the let­ter P on it.

“Can’t stay long, Moth­er,” he said. “I’m up front, the pre­fects have got two com­part­ments to them­selves —”

“Oh, are you a pre­fect, Per­cy?” said one of the twins, with an air of great sur­prise. “You should have said some­thing, we had no idea.”

“Hang on, I think I re­mem­ber him say­ing some­thing about it,” said the oth­er twin. “Once —”

“Or twice —”

“A minute —”

“All sum­mer —”

“Oh, shut up,” said Per­cy the Pre­fect.

“How come Per­cy gets new robes, any­way?” said one of the twins.

“Be­cause he’s a pre­fect,” said their moth­er fond­ly. “All right, dear, well, have a good term — send me an owl when you get there.”

She kissed Per­cy on the cheek and he left. Then she turned to the twins.

“Now, you two — this year, you be­have your­selves. If I get one more owl telling me you’ve — you’ve blown up a toi­let or —”

“Blown up a toi­let? We’ve nev­er blown up a toi­let.”

“Great idea though, thanks, Mom.”

“It’s not fun­ny. And look af­ter Ron.”

“Don’t wor­ry, ick­le Ron­niekins is safe with us.”

“Shut up,” said Ron again. He was al­most as tall as the twins al­ready and his nose was still pink where his moth­er had rubbed it.

“Hey, Mom, guess what? Guess who we just met on the train?”

Har­ry leaned back quick­ly so they couldn’t see him look­ing.

“You know that black-​haired boy who was near us in the sta­tion? Know who he is?”

“Who?”

“Har­ry Pot­ter!”

Har­ry heard the lit­tle girl’s voice.

“Oh, Mom, can I go on the train and see him, Mom, eh please....”

“You’ve al­ready seen him, Gin­ny, and the poor boy isn’t some­thing you gog­gle at in a zoo. Is he re­al­ly, Fred? How do you know?”

“Asked him. Saw his scar. It’s re­al­ly there — like light­ning.”

“Poor dear — no won­der he was alone, I won­dered. He was ev­er so po­lite when he asked how to get on­to the plat­form.”

“Nev­er mind that, do you think he re­mem­bers what You-​Know-​Who looks like?”

Their moth­er sud­den­ly be­came very stern.

“I for­bid you to ask him, Fred. No, don’t you dare. As though he needs re­mind­ing of that on his first day at school.”

“All right, keep your hair on.”

A whis­tle sound­ed.

“Hur­ry up!” their moth­er said, and the three boys clam­bered on­to the train. They leaned out of the win­dow for her to kiss them good-​bye, and their younger sis­ter be­gan to cry.

“Don’t, Gin­ny, we’ll send you loads of owls.”

“We’ll send you a Hog­warts’ toi­let seat.”

“George!”

“On­ly jok­ing, Mom.”

The train be­gan to move. Har­ry saw the boys’ moth­er wav­ing and their sis­ter, half laugh­ing, half cry­ing, run­ning to keep up with the train un­til it gath­ered too much speed, then she fell back and waved.

Har­ry watched the girl and her moth­er dis­ap­pear as the train round­ed the cor­ner. Hous­es flashed past the win­dow. Har­ry felt a great leap of ex­cite­ment. He didn’t know what he was go­ing to — but it had to be bet­ter than what he was leav­ing be­hind.

The door of the com­part­ment slid open and the youngest red­head­ed boy came in.

“Any­one sit­ting there?” he asked, point­ing at the seat op­po­site Har­ry. “Ev­ery­where else is full.”

Har­ry shook his head and the boy sat down. He glanced at Har­ry and then looked quick­ly out of the win­dow, pre­tend­ing he hadn’t looked. Har­ry saw he still had a black mark on his nose.

“Hey, Ron.”

The twins were back.

“Lis­ten, we’re go­ing down the mid­dle of the train — Lee Jor­dan’s got a gi­ant taran­tu­la down there.”

“Right,” mum­bled Ron.

“Har­ry,” said the oth­er twin, “did we in­tro­duce our­selves? Fred and George Weasley. And this is Ron, our broth­er. See you lat­er, then.”

“Bye,” said Har­ry and Ron. The twins slid the com­part­ment door shut be­hind them.

“Are you re­al­ly Har­ry Pot­ter?” Ron blurt­ed out.

Har­ry nod­ded.

“Oh — well, I thought it might be one of Fred and George’s jokes,” said Ron. “And have you re­al­ly got — you know…”

He point­ed at Har­ry’s fore­head.

Har­ry pulled back his bangs to show the light­ning scar. Ron stared.

“So that’s where You-​Know-​Who —?”

“Yes,” said Har­ry, “but I can’t re­mem­ber it.”

“Noth­ing?” said Ron ea­ger­ly.

“Well — I re­mem­ber a lot of green light, but noth­ing else.”

“Wow,” said Ron. He sat and stared at Har­ry for a few mo­ments, then, as though he had sud­den­ly re­al­ized what he was do­ing, he looked quick­ly out of the win­dow again.

“Are all your fam­ily wiz­ards?” asked Har­ry, who found Ron just as in­ter­est­ing as Ron found him.

“Er — Yes, I think so,” said Ron. “I think Mom’s got a sec­ond cousin who’s an ac­coun­tant, but we nev­er talk about him.”

“So you must know loads of mag­ic al­ready.”

The Weasleys were clear­ly one of those old wiz­ard­ing fam­ilies the pale boy in Di­agon Al­ley had talked about.

“I heard you went to live with Mug­gles,” said Ron. “What are they like?”

“Hor­ri­ble — well, not all of them. My aunt and un­cle and cousin are, though. Wish I’d had three wiz­ard broth­ers.”

“Five,” said Ron. For some rea­son, he was look­ing gloomy. “I’m the sixth in our fam­ily to go to Hog­warts. You could say I’ve got a lot to live up to. Bill and Char­lie have al­ready left — Bill was head boy and Char­lie was cap­tain of Quid­ditch. Now Per­cy’s a pre­fect. Fred and George mess around a lot, but they still get re­al­ly good marks and ev­ery­one thinks they’re re­al­ly fun­ny. Ev­ery­one ex­pects me to do as well as the oth­ers, but if I do, it’s no big deal, be­cause they did it first. You nev­er get any­thing new, ei­ther, with five broth­ers. I’ve got Bill’s old robes, Char­lie’s old wand, and Per­cy’s old rat.”

Ron reached in­side his jack­et and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was asleep.

“His name’s Scab­bers and he’s use­less, he hard­ly ev­er wakes up. Per­cy got an owl from my dad for be­ing made a pre­fect, but they couldn’t aff — I mean, I got Scab­bers in­stead.”

Ron’s ears went pink. He seemed to think he’d said too much, be­cause he went back to star­ing out of the win­dow.

Har­ry didn’t think there was any­thing wrong with not be­ing able to af­ford an owl. Af­ter all, he’d nev­er had any mon­ey in his life un­til a month ago, and he told Ron so, all about hav­ing to wear Dud­ley’s old clothes and nev­er get­ting prop­er birth­day presents. This seemed to cheer Ron up.

“…and un­til Ha­grid told me, I didn’t know any­thing about be­ing a wiz­ard or about my par­ents or Volde­mort —”

Ron gasped.

“What?” said Har­ry.

“You said You-​Know-​Who’s name!” said Ron, sound­ing both shocked and im­pressed. “I’d have thought you, of all peo­ple —”

“I’m not try­ing to be brave or any­thing, say­ing the name,” said Har­ry, “I just nev­er knew you shouldn’t. See what I mean? I’ve got loads to learn.…I bet,” he added, voic­ing for the first time some­thing that had been wor­ry­ing him a lot late­ly, “I bet I’m the worst in the class.”

“You won’t be. There’s loads of peo­ple who come from Mug­gle fam­ilies and they learn quick enough.”

While they had been talk­ing, the train had car­ried them out of Lon­don. Now they were speed­ing past fields full of cows and sheep. They were qui­et for a time, watch­ing the fields and lanes flick past.

Around half past twelve there was a great clat­ter­ing out­side in the cor­ri­dor and a smil­ing, dim­pled wom­an slid back their door and said, “Any­thing off the cart, dears?”

Har­ry, who hadn’t had any break­fast, leapt to his feet, but Ron’s ears went pink again and he mut­tered that he’d brought sand­wich­es. Har­ry went out in­to the cor­ri­dor.

He had nev­er had any mon­ey for can­dy with the Durs­leys, and now that he had pock­ets rat­tling with gold and sil­ver he was ready to buy as many Mars Bars as he could car­ry — but the wom­an didn’t have Mars Bars. What she did have were Bet­tie Bott’s Ev­ery Fla­vor Beans, Drooble’s Best Blow­ing Gum, Choco­late Frogs. Pump­kin Pasties, Caul­dron Cakes, Licorice Wands, and a num­ber of oth­er strange things Har­ry had nev­er seen in his life. Not want­ing to miss any­thing, he got some of ev­ery­thing and paid the wom­an eleven sil­ver Sick­les and sev­en bronze Knuts.

Ron stared as Har­ry brought it all back in to the com­part­ment and tipped it on­to an emp­ty seat.

“Hun­gry, are you?”

“Starv­ing,” said Har­ry, tak­ing a large bite out of a pump­kin pasty.

Ron had tak­en out a lumpy pack­age and un­wrapped it. There were four sand­wich­es in­side. He pulled one of them apart and said, “She al­ways for­gets I don’t like corned beef..”

“Swap you for one of these,” said Har­ry, hold­ing up a pasty. “Go on —”

“You don’t want this, it’s all dry,” said Ron. “She hasn’t got much time,” he added quick­ly, “you know, with five of us.”

“Go on, have a pasty,” said Har­ry, who had nev­er had any­thing to share be­fore or, in­deed, any­one to share it with. It was a nice feel­ing, sit­ting there with Ron, eat­ing their way through all Har­ry’s pasties, cakes, and can­dies (the sand­wich­es lay for­got­ten).

“What are these?” Har­ry asked Ron, hold­ing up a pack of Choco­late Frogs. “They’re not re­al­ly frogs, are they?” He was start­ing to feel that noth­ing would sur­prise him.

“No,” said Ron. “But see what the card is. I’m miss­ing Agrip­pa.”

“What?”

“Oh, of course, you wouldn’t know — Choco­late Frogs have cards, in­side them, you know, to col­lect — fa­mous witch­es and wiz­ards. I’ve got about five hun­dred, but I haven’t got Agrip­pa or Ptole­my.”

Har­ry un­wrapped his Choco­late Frog and picked up the card. It showed a man’s face. He wore half-​moon glass­es, had a long, crooked nose, and flow­ing sil­ver hair, beard, and mus­tache. Un­der­neath the pic­ture was the name Al­bus Dum­ble­dore.

“So this is Dum­ble­dore!” said Har­ry.

“Don’t tell me you’d nev­er heard of Dum­ble­dore!” said Ron. “Can I have a frog? I might get Agrip­pa — thanks —”

Har­ry turned over his card and read:



AL­BUS DUM­BLE­DORE

CUR­RENT­LY HEAD­MAS­TER OF HOG­WARTS



C on­sid­ered by many the great­est wiz­ard of mod­ern times, Dum­ble­dore is par­tic­ular­ly fa­mous for his de­feat of the dark wiz­ard Grindel­wald in 1945, for the dis­cov­ery of the twelve us­es of drag­on’s blood, and his work on alche­my with his part­ner, Nico­las Flamel. Pro­fes­sor Dum­ble­dore en­joys cham­ber mu­sic and ten­pin bowl­ing.



Har­ry turned the card back over and saw, to his as­ton­ish­ment, that Dum­ble­dore’s face had dis­ap­peared.

“He’s gone!”

“Well, you can’t ex­pect him to hang around all day,” said Ron. “He’ll be back. No, I’ve got Mor­gana again and I’ve got about six of her…do you want it? You can start col­lect­ing.”

Ron’s eyes strayed to the pile of Choco­late Frogs wait­ing to be un­wrapped.

“Help your­self,” said Har­ry. “But in, you know, the Mug­gle world, peo­ple just stay put in pho­tos.”

“Do they? What, they don’t move at all?” Ron sound­ed amazed. “Weird!”

Har­ry stared as Dum­ble­dore si­dled back in­to the pic­ture on his card and gave him a small smile. Ron was more in­ter­est­ed in eat­ing the frogs than look­ing at the Fa­mous Witch­es and Wiz­ards cards, but Har­ry couldn’t keep his eyes off them. Soon he had not on­ly Dum­ble­dore and Mor­gana, but Hengist of Wood­croft, Al­ber­ic Grun­nion, Circe, Paracel­sus, and Mer­lin. He fi­nal­ly tore his eyes away from the Druidess Cliod­na, who was scratch­ing her nose, to open a bag of Bertie Bott’s Ev­ery Fla­vor Beans.

“You want to be care­ful with those,” Ron warned Har­ry. “When they say ev­ery fla­vor, they mean ev­ery fla­vor — you know, you get all the or­di­nary ones like choco­late and pep­per­mint and mar­malade, but then you can get spinach and liv­er and tripe. George reck­ons he had a booger-​fla­vored one once.”

Ron picked up a green bean, looked at it care­ful­ly, and bit in­to a cor­ner.

“Bleaaargh — see? Sprouts.”

They had a good time eat­ing the Ev­ery Fla­vor Beans. Har­ry got toast, co­conut, baked bean, straw­ber­ry, cur­ry, grass, cof­fee, sar­dine, and was even brave enough to nib­ble the end off a fun­ny gray one Ron wouldn’t touch, which turned out to be pep­per.

The coun­try­side now fly­ing past the win­dow was be­com­ing wilder. The neat fields had gone. Now there were woods, twist­ing rivers, and dark green hills.

There was a knock on the door of their com­part­ment and the round-​faced boy Har­ry had passed on plat­form nine and three-​quar­ters came in. He looked tear­ful.

“Sor­ry,” he said, “but have you seen a toad at all?”

When they shook their heads, he wailed, “I’ve lost him! He keeps get­ting away from me!”

“He’ll turn up,” said Har­ry.

“Yes,” said the boy mis­er­ably. “Well, if you see him…”

He left.

“Don’t know why he’s so both­ered,” said Ron. “If I’d brought a toad I’d lose it as quick as I could. Mind you, I brought Scab­bers, so I can’t talk.”

The rat was still snooz­ing on Ron’s lap.

“He might have died and you wouldn’t know the dif­fer­ence,” said Ron in dis­gust. “I tried to turn him yel­low yes­ter­day to make him more in­ter­est­ing, but the spell didn’t work. I’ll show you, look…”

He rum­maged around in his trunk and pulled out a very bat­tered-​look­ing wand. It was chipped in places and some­thing white was glint­ing at the end.

“Uni­corn hair’s near­ly pok­ing out. Any­way —”

He had just raised his wand when the com­part­ment door slid open again. The toad­less boy was back, but this time he had a girl with him. She was al­ready wear­ing her new Hog­warts robes.

“Has any­one seen a toad? Neville’s lost one,” she said. She had a bossy sort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair, and rather large front teeth.

“We’ve al­ready told him we haven’t seen it,” said Ron, but the girl wasn’t lis­ten­ing, she was look­ing at the wand in his hand.

“Oh, are you do­ing mag­ic? Let’s see it, then.”

She sat down. Ron looked tak­en aback.

“Er — all right.”

He cleared his throat.



“Sun­shine, daisies, but­ter mel­low,

Turn this stupid, fat rat yel­low.”



He waved his wand, but noth­ing hap­pened. Scab­bers stayed gray and fast asleep.

“Are you sure that’s a re­al spell?” said the girl. “Well, it’s not very good, is it? I’ve tried a few sim­ple spells just for prac­tice and it’s all worked for me. No­body in my fam­ily’s mag­ic at all, it was ev­er such a sur­prise when I got my let­ter, but I was ev­er so pleased, of course, I mean, it’s the very best school of witchcraft there is, I’ve heard — I’ve learned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough — I’m Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you?”

She said all this very fast.

Har­ry looked at Ron, and was re­lieved to see by his stunned face that he hadn’t learned all the course books by heart ei­ther.

“I’m Ron Weasley,” Ron mut­tered.

“Har­ry Pot­ter,” said Har­ry.

“Are you re­al­ly?” said Hermione. “I know all about you, of course — I got a few ex­tra books, for back­ground read­ing, and you’re in Mod­ern Mag­ical His­to­ry and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wiz­ard­ing Events of the Twen­ti­eth Cen­tu­ry.”

“Am I?” said Har­ry, feel­ing dazed.

“Good­ness, didn’t you know, I’d have found out ev­ery­thing I could if it was me,” said Hermione. “Do ei­ther of you know what house you’ll be in? I’ve been ask­ing around, and I hope I’m in Gryffind­or, it sounds by far the best; I hear Dum­ble­dore him­self was in it, but I sup­pose Raven­claw wouldn’t be too bad....Any­way, we’d bet­ter go and look for Neville’s toad. You two had bet­ter change, you know, I ex­pect we’ll be there soon.”

And she left, tak­ing the toad­less boy with her.

“What­ev­er house I’m in, I hope she’s not in it,” said Ron. He threw his wand back in­to his trunk. “Stupid spell — George gave it to me, bet he knew it was a dud.”

“What house are your broth­ers in?” asked Har­ry.

“Gryffind­or,” said Ron. Gloom seemed to be set­tling on him again. “Mom and Dad were in it, too. I don’t know what they’ll say if I’m not. I don’t sup­pose Raven­claw would be too bad, but imag­ine if they put me in Slytherin.”

“That’s the house Vol-, I mean, You-​Know-​Who was in?”

“Yeah,” said Ron. He flopped back in­to his seat, look­ing de­pressed.

“You know, I think the ends of Scab­bers’ whiskers are a bit lighter,” said Har­ry, try­ing to take Ron’s mind off hous­es. “So what do your old­est broth­ers do now that they’ve left, any­way?”

Har­ry was won­der­ing what a wiz­ard did once he’d fin­ished school.

“Char­lie’s in Ro­ma­nia study­ing drag­ons, and Bill’s in Africa do­ing some­thing for Gringotts,” said Ron. “Did you hear about Gringotts? It’s been all over the Dai­ly Prophet, but I don’t sup­pose you get that with the Mug­gles — some­one tried to rob a high se­cu­ri­ty vault.”

Har­ry stared.

“Re­al­ly? What hap­pened to them?”

“Noth­ing, that’s why it’s such big news. They haven’t been caught. My dad says it must’ve been a pow­er­ful Dark wiz­ard to get round Gringotts, but they don’t think they took any­thing, that’s what’s odd. ’Course, ev­ery­one gets scared when some­thing like this hap­pens in case You-​Know-​Who’s be­hind it.”

Har­ry turned this news over in his mind. He was start­ing to get a prick­le of fear ev­ery time You-​Know-​Who was men­tioned. He sup­posed this was all part of en­ter­ing the mag­ical world, but it had been a lot more com­fort­able say­ing “Volde­mort” with­out wor­ry­ing.

“What’s your Quid­ditch team?” Ron asked.

“Er — I don’t know any.” Har­ry con­fessed.

“What!” Ron looked dumb­found­ed. “Oh, you wait, it’s the best game in the world —” And he was off, ex­plain­ing all about the four balls and the po­si­tions of the sev­en play­ers, de­scrib­ing fa­mous games he’d been to with his broth­ers and the broom­stick he’d like to get if he had the mon­ey. He was just tak­ing Har­ry through the fin­er points of the game when the com­part­ment door slid open yet again, but it wasn’t Neville the toad­less boy, or Hermione Granger this time.

Three boys en­tered, and Har­ry rec­og­nized the mid­dle one at once: it was the pale boy from Madam Malkin’s robe shop. He was look­ing at Har­ry with a lot more in­ter­est than he’d shown back in Di­agon Al­ley.

“Is it true?” he said. “They’re say­ing all down the train that Har­ry Pot­ter’s in this com­part­ment. So it’s you, is it?”

“Yes,” said Har­ry. He was look­ing at the oth­er boys. Both of them were thick­set and looked ex­treme­ly mean. Stand­ing on ei­ther side of the pale boy, they looked like body­guards.

“Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,” said the pale boy care­less­ly, notic­ing where Har­ry was look­ing. “And my name’s Mal­foy, Dra­co Mal­foy.”

Ron gave a slight cough, which might have been hid­ing a snig­ger. Dra­co Mal­foy looked at him.

“Think my name’s fun­ny, do you? No need to ask who you are. My fa­ther told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freck­les, and more chil­dren than they can af­ford.”

He turned back to Har­ry. “You’ll soon find out some wiz­ard­ing fam­ilies are much bet­ter than oth­ers, Pot­ter. You don’t want to go mak­ing friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.”

He held out his hand to shake Har­ry’s, but Har­ry didn’t take it.

“I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for my­self, thanks,” he said cool­ly.

Dra­co Mal­foy didn’t go red, but a pink tinge ap­peared in his pale cheeks.

“I’d be care­ful if I were you, Pot­ter,” he said slow­ly. “Un­less you’re a bit po­liter you’ll go the same way as your par­ents. They didn’t know what was good for them, ei­ther. You hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys and that Ha­grid, and it’ll rub off on you.”

Both Har­ry and Ron stood up.

“Say that again,” Ron said, his face as red as his hair.

“Oh, you’re go­ing to fight us, are you?” Mal­foy sneered.

“Un­less you get out now,” said Har­ry, more brave­ly than he felt, be­cause Crabbe and Goyle were a lot big­ger than him or Ron.

“But we don’t feet like leav­ing, do we, boys? We’ve eat­en all our food and you still seem to have some.”

Goyle reached to­ward the Choco­late Frogs next to Ron — Ron leapt for­ward, but be­fore he’d so much as touched Goyle, Goyle let out a hor­ri­ble yell.

Scab­bers the rat was hang­ing off his fin­ger, sharp lit­tle teeth sunk deep in­to Goyle’s knuck­le — Crabbe and Mal­foy backed away as Goyle swung Scab­bers round and round, howl­ing, and when Scab­bers fi­nal­ly flew off and hit the win­dow, all three of them dis­ap­peared at once. Per­haps they thought there were more rats lurk­ing among the sweets, or per­haps they’d heard foot­steps, be­cause a sec­ond lat­er, Hermione Granger had come in.

“What has been go­ing on?” she said, look­ing at the sweets all over the floor and Ron pick­ing up Scab­bers by his tail.

“I think he’s been knocked out,” Ron said to Har­ry. He looked clos­er at Scab­bers. “No — I don’t be­lieve it — he’s gone back to sleep.”

And so he had.

“You’ve met Mal­foy be­fore?”

Har­ry ex­plained about their meet­ing in Di­agon Al­ley.

“I’ve heard of his fam­ily,” said Ron dark­ly. “They were some of the first to come back to our side af­ter You-​Know-​Who dis­ap­peared. Said they’d been be­witched. My dad doesn’t be­lieve it. He says Mal­foy’s fa­ther didn’t need an ex­cuse to go over to the Dark Side.” He turned to Hermione. “Can we help you with some­thing?”

“You’d bet­ter hur­ry up and put your robes on, I’ve just been up to the front to ask the con­duc­tor, and he says we’re near­ly there. You haven’t been fight­ing, have you? You’ll be in trou­ble be­fore we even get there!”

“Scab­bers has been fight­ing, not us,” said Ron, scowl­ing at her. “Would you mind leav­ing while we change?”

“All right — I on­ly came in here be­cause peo­ple out­side are be­hav­ing very child­ish­ly, rac­ing up and down the cor­ri­dors,” said Hermione in a sniffy voice. “And you’ve got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you know?”

Ron glared at her as she left. Har­ry peered out of the win­dow. It was get­ting dark. He could see moun­tains and forests un­der a deep pur­ple sky. The train did seem to be slow­ing down.

He and Ron took off their jack­ets and pulled on their long black robes. Ron’s were a bit short for him, you could see his sneak­ers un­der­neath them.

A voice echoed through the train: “We will be reach­ing Hog­warts in five min­utes’ time. Please leave your lug­gage on the train, it will be tak­en to the school sep­arate­ly.”

Har­ry’s stom­ach lurched with nerves and Ron, he saw, looked pale un­der his freck­les. They crammed their pock­ets with the last of the sweets and joined the crowd throng­ing the cor­ri­dor.

The train slowed right down and fi­nal­ly stopped. Peo­ple pushed their way to­ward the door and out on to a tiny, dark plat­form. Har­ry shiv­ered in the cold night air. Then a lamp came bob­bing over the heads of the stu­dents, and Har­ry heard a fa­mil­iar voice: “Firs’ years! Firs’ years over here! All right there, Har­ry?”

Ha­grid’s big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads.

“C’mon, fol­low me — any more firs’ years? Mind yer step, now! Firs’ years fol­low me!”

Slip­ping and stum­bling, they fol­lowed Ha­grid down what seemed to be a steep, nar­row path. It was so dark on ei­ther side of them that Har­ry thought there must be thick trees there. No­body spoke much. Neville, the boy who kept los­ing his toad, sniffed once or twice.

“Yeh’ll get yer firs’ sight o’ Hog­warts in a sec,” Ha­grid called over his shoul­der, “jus’ round this bend here.”

There was a loud “Oooooh!”

The nar­row path had opened sud­den­ly on­to the edge of a great black lake. Perched atop a high moun­tain on the oth­er side, its win­dows sparkling in the star­ry sky, was a vast cas­tle with many tur­rets and tow­ers.

“No more’n four to a boat!” Ha­grid called, point­ing to a fleet of lit­tle boats sit­ting in the wa­ter by the shore. Har­ry and Ron were fol­lowed in­to their boat by Neville and Hermione.

“Ev­ery­one in?” shout­ed Ha­grid, who had a boat to him­self. “Right then — FOR­WARD!”

And the fleet of lit­tle boats moved off all at once, glid­ing across the lake, which was as smooth as glass. Ev­ery­one was silent, star­ing up at the great cas­tle over­head. It tow­ered over them as they sailed near­er and near­er to the cliff on which it stood.

“Heads down!” yelled Ha­grid as the first boats reached the cliff; they all bent their heads and the lit­tle boats car­ried them through a cur­tain of ivy that hid a wide open­ing in the cliff face. They were car­ried along a dark tun­nel, which seemed to be tak­ing them right un­der­neath the cas­tle, un­til they reached a kind of un­der­ground har­bor, where they clam­bered out on­to rocks and peb­bles.

“Oy, you there! Is this your toad?” said Ha­grid, who was check­ing the boats as peo­ple climbed out of them.

“Trevor!” cried Neville bliss­ful­ly, hold­ing out his hands. Then they clam­bered up a pas­sage­way in the rock af­ter Ha­grid’s lamp, com­ing out at last on­to smooth, damp grass right in the shad­ow of the cas­tle.

They walked up a flight of stone steps and crowd­ed around the huge, oak front door.

“Ev­ery­one here? You there, still got yer toad?”

Ha­grid raised a gi­gan­tic fist and knocked three times on the cas­tle door.

CHAPTER SEVEN




THE SORT­ING HAT



T he door swung open at once. A tall, black-​haired witch in emer­ald-​green robes stood there. She had a very stern face and Har­ry’s first thought was that this was not some­one to cross.

“The firs’ years, Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall,” said Ha­grid.

“Thank you, Ha­grid. I will take them from here.”

She pulled the door wide. The en­trance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the Durs­leys’ house in it. The stone walls were lit with flam­ing torch­es like the ones at Gringotts, the ceil­ing was too high to make out, and a mag­nif­icent mar­ble stair­case fac­ing them led to the up­per floors.

They fol­lowed Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall across the flagged stone floor. Har­ry could hear the drone of hun­dreds of voic­es from a door­way to the right — the rest of the school must al­ready be here — but Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall showed the first years in­to a small, emp­ty cham­ber off the hall. They crowd­ed in, stand­ing rather clos­er to­geth­er than they would usu­al­ly have done, peer­ing about ner­vous­ly.

“Wel­come to Hog­warts,” said Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall. “The start-​of-​term ban­quet will be­gin short­ly, but be­fore you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sort­ed in­to your hous­es. The Sort­ing is a very im­por­tant cer­emo­ny be­cause, while you are here, your house will be some­thing like your fam­ily with­in Hog­warts. You will have class­es with the rest of your house, sleep in your house dor­mi­to­ry, and spend free time in your house com­mon room.

“The four hous­es are called Gryffind­or, Huf­flepuff, Raven­claw, and Slytherin. Each house has its own no­ble his­to­ry and each has pro­duced out­stand­ing witch­es and wiz­ards. While you are at Hog­warts, your tri­umphs will earn your house points, while any rule­break­ing will lose house points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is award­ed the house cup, a great hon­or. I hope each of you will be a cred­it to whichev­er house be­comes yours.

“The Sort­ing Cer­emo­ny will take place in a few min­utes in front of the rest of the school. I sug­gest you all smarten your­selves up as much as you can while you are wait­ing.”

Her eyes lin­gered for a mo­ment on Neville’s cloak, which was fas­tened un­der his left ear, and on Ron’s smudged nose. Har­ry ner­vous­ly tried to flat­ten his hair.

“I shall re­turn when we are ready for you,” said Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall. “Please wait qui­et­ly.”

She left the cham­ber. Har­ry swal­lowed.

“How ex­act­ly do they sort us in­to hous­es?” he asked Ron.

“Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he was jok­ing.”

Har­ry’s heart gave a hor­ri­ble jolt. A test? In front of the whole school? But he didn’t know any mag­ic yet —what on earth would he have to do? He hadn’t ex­pect­ed some­thing like this the mo­ment they ar­rived. He looked around anx­ious­ly and saw that ev­ery­one else looked ter­ri­fied, too. No one was talk­ing much ex­cept Hermione Granger, who was whis­per­ing very fast about all the spells she’d learned and won­der­ing which one she’d need. Har­ry tried hard not to lis­ten to her. He’d nev­er been more ner­vous, nev­er, not even when he’d had to take a school re­port home to the Durs­leys say­ing that he’d some­how turned his teach­er’s wig blue. He kept his eyes fixed on the door. Any sec­ond now, Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall would come back and lead him to his doom.

Then some­thing hap­pened that made him jump about a foot in the air — sev­er­al peo­ple be­hind him screamed.

“What the —?”

He gasped. So did the peo­ple around him. About twen­ty ghosts had just streamed through the back wall. Pearly-​white and slight­ly trans­par­ent, they glid­ed across the room talk­ing to one an­oth­er and hard­ly glanc­ing at the first years. They seemed to be ar­gu­ing. What looked like a fat lit­tle monk was say­ing: “For­give and for­get, I say, we ought to give him a sec­ond chance —”

“My dear Fri­ar, haven’t we giv­en Peeves all the chances he de­serves? He gives us all a bad name and you know, he’s not re­al­ly even a ghost — I say, what are you all do­ing here?”

A ghost wear­ing a ruff and tights had sud­den­ly no­ticed the first years.

No­body an­swered.

“New stu­dents!” said the Fat Fri­ar, smil­ing around at them. “About to be Sort­ed, I sup­pose?”

A few peo­ple nod­ded mute­ly.

“Hope to see you in Huf­flepuff!” said the Fri­ar. “My old house, you know.”

“Move along now,” said a sharp voice. “The Sort­ing Cer­emo­ny’s about to start.”

Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall had re­turned. One by one, the ghosts float­ed away through the op­po­site wall.

“Now, form a line,” Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall told the first years, “and fol­low me.”

Feel­ing odd­ly as though his legs had turned to lead, Har­ry got in­to line be­hind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron be­hind him, and they walked out of the cham­ber, back across the hall, and through a pair of dou­ble doors in­to the Great Hall.

Har­ry had nev­er even imag­ined such a strange and splen­did place. It was lit by thou­sands and thou­sands of can­dles that were float­ing in midair over four long ta­bles, where the rest of the stu­dents were sit­ting. These ta­bles were laid with glit­ter­ing gold­en plates and gob­lets. At the top of the hall was an­oth­er long ta­ble where the teach­ers were sit­ting. Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall led the first years up here, so that they came to a halt in a line fac­ing the oth­er stu­dents, with the teach­ers be­hind them. The hun­dreds of faces star­ing at them looked like pale lanterns in the flick­er­ing can­dle­light. Dot­ted here and there among the stu­dents, the ghosts shone misty sil­ver. Main­ly to avoid all the star­ing eyes, Har­ry looked up­ward and saw a vel­vety black ceil­ing dot­ted with stars. He heard Hermione whis­per, “Its be­witched to look like the sky out­side. I read about it in Hog­warts, A His­to­ry.”

It was hard to be­lieve there was a ceil­ing there at all, and that the Great Hall didn’t sim­ply open on to the heav­ens.

Har­ry quick­ly looked down again as Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall silent­ly placed a four-​legged stool in front of the first years. On top of the stool she put a point­ed wiz­ard’s hat. This hat was patched and frayed and ex­treme­ly dirty. Aunt Petu­nia wouldn’t have let it in the house.

Maybe they had to try and get a rab­bit out of it, Har­ry thought wild­ly, that seemed the sort of thing — notic­ing that ev­ery­one in the hall was now star­ing at the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few sec­onds, there was com­plete si­lence. Then the hat twitched. A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth — and the hat be­gan to sing:



“Oh, you may not think I’m pret­ty,

But don’t judge on what you see,

I’ll eat my­self if you can find

A smarter hat than me.

You can keep your bowlers black,

Your top hats sleek and tall,

For I’m the Hog­warts Sort­ing Hat

And I can cap them all.

There’s noth­ing hid­den in your head

The Sort­ing Hat can’t see,

So try me on and I will tell you

Where you ought to be.

You might be­long in Gryffind­or,

Where dwell the brave at heart,

Their dar­ing, nerve, and chival­ry

Set Gryffind­ors apart;

You might be­long in Huf­flepuff,

Where they are just and loy­al,

Those pa­tient Huf­flepuffs are true

And un­afraid of toil;

Or yet in wise old Raven­claw,

if you’ve a ready mind,

Where those of wit and learn­ing,

Will al­ways find their kind;

Or per­haps in Slytherin

You’ll make your re­al friends,

Those cun­ning folk use any means

To achieve their ends.

So put me on! Don’t be afraid!

And don’t get in a flap!

You’re in safe hands (though I have none)

For I’m a Think­ing Cap!”



The whole hall burst in­to ap­plause as the hat fin­ished its song. It bowed to each of the four ta­bles and then be­came quite still again.

“So we’ve just got to try on the hat!” Ron whis­pered to Har­ry. “I’ll kill Fred, he was go­ing on about wrestling a troll.”

Har­ry. smiled weak­ly. Yes, try­ing on the hat was a lot bet­ter than hav­ing to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on with­out ev­ery­one watch­ing. The hat seemed to be ask­ing rather a lot; Har­ry didn’t feel brave or quick-​wit­ted or any of it at the mo­ment. If on­ly the hat had men­tioned a house for peo­ple who felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for him.

Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall now stepped for­ward hold­ing a long roll of parch­ment.

“When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sort­ed,” she said. “Ab­bott, Han­nah!”

A pink-​faced girl with blonde pig­tails stum­bled out of line, put on the hat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down. A mo­ments pause —

“HUF­FLEPUFF!” shout­ed the hat.

The ta­ble on the right cheered and clapped as Han­nah went to sit down at the Huf­flepuff ta­ble. Har­ry saw the ghost of the Fat Fri­ar wav­ing mer­ri­ly at her.

“Bones, Su­san!”

“HUF­FLEPUFF!” shout­ed the hat again, and Su­san scut­tled off to sit next to Han­nah.

“Boot, Ter­ry!”

“RAVEN­CLAW!”

The ta­ble sec­ond from the left clapped this time; sev­er­al Raven­claws stood up to shake hands with Ter­ry as he joined them.

“Brock­le­hurst, Mandy” went to Raven­claw too, but “Brown, Laven­der” be­came the first new Gryffind­or, and the ta­ble on the far left ex­plod­ed with cheers; Har­ry could see Ron’s twin broth­ers cat­call­ing.

“Bul­strode, Mil­li­cent” then be­came a Slytherin. Per­haps it was Har­ry’s imag­ina­tion, af­ter all he’d heard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked like an un­pleas­ant lot.

He was start­ing to feel def­inite­ly sick now. He re­mem­bered be­ing picked for teams dur­ing gym at his old school. He had al­ways been last to be cho­sen, not be­cause he was no good, but be­cause no one want­ed Dud­ley to think they liked him.

“Finch-​Fletch­ley, Justin!”

“HUF­FLEPUFF!”

Some­times, Har­ry no­ticed, the hat shout­ed out the house at once, but at oth­ers it took a lit­tle while to de­cide. “Finni­gan, Sea­mus,” the sandy-​haired boy next to Har­ry in the line, sat on the stool for al­most a whole minute be­fore the hat de­clared him a Gryffind­or.

“Granger, Hermione!”

Her mione al­most ran to the stool and jammed the hat ea­ger­ly on her head.

“GRYFFIND­OR!” shout­ed the hat. Ron groaned.

A hor­ri­ble thought struck Har­ry, as hor­ri­ble thoughts al­ways do when you’re very ner­vous. What if he wasn’t cho­sen at all? What if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, un­til Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall jerked it off his head and said there had ob­vi­ous­ly been a mis­take and he’d bet­ter get back on the train?

When Neville Long­bot­tom, the boy who kept los­ing his toad, was called, he fell over on his way to the stool. The hat took a long time to de­cide with Neville. When it fi­nal­ly shout­ed, “GRYFFIND­OR,” Neville ran off still wear­ing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laugh­ter to give it to “Mac­Dou­gal, Mor­ag.”

Mal­foy swag­gered for­ward when his name was called and got his wish at once: the hat had bare­ly touched his head when it screamed, “SLYTHERIN!”

Mal­foy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, look­ing pleased with him­self.

There weren’t many peo­ple left now. “Moon”…, “Nott”…, “Parkin­son”…, then a pair of twin girls, “Patil” and “Patil”…, then “Perks, Sal­ly-​Anne”…, and then, at last —

“Pot­ter, Har­ry!”

As Har­ry stepped for­ward, whis­pers sud­den­ly broke out like lit­tle hiss­ing fires all over the hall.

“Pot­ter, did she say?”

“The Har­ry Pot­ter?”

The last thing Har­ry saw be­fore the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of peo­ple cran­ing to get a good look at him. Next sec­ond he was look­ing at the black in­side of the hat. He wait­ed.

“Hmm,” said a small voice in his ear. “Dif­fi­cult. Very dif­fi­cult. Plen­ty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind ei­ther. There’s tal­ent, A my good­ness, yes — and a nice thirst to prove your­self, now that’s in­ter­est­ing….So where shall I put you?”

Har­ry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not Slytherin.

“Not Slytherin, eh?” said the small voice. “Are you sure? You could be great, you know, it’s all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to great­ness, no doubt about that — no? Well, if you’re sure — bet­ter be GRYFFIND­OR!”

Har­ry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall. He took off the hat and walked shak­ily to­ward the Gryffind­or ta­ble. He was so re­lieved to have been cho­sen and not put in Slytherin, he hard­ly no­ticed that he was get­ting the loud­est cheer yet. Per­cy the Pre­fect got up and shook his hand vig­or­ous­ly, while the Weasley twins yelled, “We got Pot­ter! We got Pot­ter!” Har­ry sat down op­po­site the ghost in the ruff he’d seen ear­li­er. The ghost pat­ted his arm, giv­ing Har­ry the sud­den, hor­ri­ble feel­ing he’d just plunged it in­to a buck­et of ice-​cold wa­ter.

He could see the High Ta­ble prop­er­ly now. At the end near­est him sat Ha­grid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up. Har­ry grinned back. And there, in the cen­ter of the High Ta­ble, in a large gold chair, sat Al­bus Dum­ble­dore. Har­ry rec­og­nized him at once from the card he’d got­ten out of the Choco­late Frog on the train. Dum­ble­dore’s sil­ver hair was the on­ly thing in the whole hall that shone as bright­ly as the ghosts. Har­ry spot­ted Pro­fes­sor Quir­rell, too, the ner­vous young man from the Leaky Caul­dron. He was look­ing very pe­cu­liar in a large pur­ple tur­ban.

And now there were on­ly three peo­ple left to be sort­ed. “Thomas, Dean,” a Black boy even taller than Ron, joined Har­ry at the Gryffind­or ta­ble. “Turpin, Lisa,” be­came a Raven­claw and then it was Ron’s turn. He was pale green by now. Har­ry crossed his fin­gers un­der the ta­ble and a sec­ond lat­er the hat had shout­ed, “GRYFFIND­OR!”

Har­ry clapped loud­ly with the rest as Ron col­lapsed in­to the chair next to him.

“Well done, Ron, ex­cel­lent,” said Per­cy Weasley pompous­ly across Har­ry as “Zabi­ni, Blaise,” was made a Slytherin. Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall rolled up her scroll and took the Sort­ing Hat away.

Har­ry looked down at his emp­ty gold plate. He had on­ly just re­al­ized how hun­gry he was. The pump­kin pasties seemed ages ago.

Al­bus Dum­ble­dore had got­ten to his feet. He was beam­ing at the stu­dents, his arms opened wide, as if noth­ing could have pleased him more than to see them all there.

“Wel­come,” he said. “Wel­come to a new year at Hog­warts! Be­fore we be­gin our ban­quet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blub­ber! Odd­ment! Tweak!

“Thank you!”

He sat back down. Ev­ery­body clapped and cheered. Har­ry didn’t know whether to laugh or not.

“Is he — a bit mad?” he asked Per­cy un­cer­tain­ly.

“Mad?” said Per­cy air­ily. “He’s a ge­nius! Best wiz­ard in the world! But he is a bit mad, yes. Pota­toes, Har­ry?”

Har­ry’s mouth fell open. The dish­es in front of him were now piled with food. He had nev­er seen so many things he liked to eat on one ta­ble: roast beef, roast chick­en, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, ba­con and steak, boiled pota­toes, roast pota­toes, fries, York­shire pud­ding, peas, car­rots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some strange rea­son, pep­per­mint hum­bugs.

The Durs­leys had nev­er ex­act­ly starved Har­ry, but he’d nev­er been al­lowed to eat as much as he liked. Dud­ley had al­ways tak­en any­thing that Har­ry re­al­ly want­ed, even if It made him sick. Har­ry piled his plate with a bit of ev­ery­thing ex­cept the pep­per­mints and be­gan to eat. It was all de­li­cious.

“That does look good,” said the ghost in the ruff sad­ly, watch­ing Har­ry cut up his steak.

“Can’t you —?”

“I haven’t eat­en for near­ly five hun­dred years,” said the ghost. “I don’t need to, of course, but one does miss it. I don’t think I’ve in­tro­duced my­self? Sir Nicholas de Mim­sy-​Por­ping­ton at your ser­vice. Res­ident ghost of Gryffind­or Tow­er.”

“I know who you are!” said Ron sud­den­ly. “My broth­ers told me about you — you’re Near­ly Head­less Nick!”

“I would pre­fer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mim­sy —” the ghost be­gan stiffly, but sandy-​haired Sea­mus Finni­gan in­ter­rupt­ed.

“Near­ly Head­less? How can you be near­ly head­less?”

Sir Nicholas looked ex­treme­ly miffed, as if their lit­tle chat wasn’t go­ing at all the way he want­ed.

“Like this,” he said ir­ri­ta­bly. He seized his left ear and pulled. His whole head swung off his neck and fell on­to his shoul­der as if it was on a hinge. Some­one had ob­vi­ous­ly tried to be­head him, but not done it prop­er­ly. Look­ing pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Near­ly Head­less Nick flipped his head back on­to his neck, coughed, and said, “So — new Gryffind­ors! I hope you’re go­ing to help us win the house cham­pi­onship this year? Gryffind­ors have nev­er gone so long with­out win­ning. Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row! The Bloody Baron’s be­com­ing al­most un­bear­able — he’s the Slytherin ghost.”

Har­ry looked over at the Slytherin ta­ble and saw a hor­ri­ble ghost sit­ting there, with blank star­ing eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with sil­ver blood. He was right next to Mal­foy who, Har­ry was pleased to see, didn’t look too pleased with the seat­ing ar­range­ments.

“How did he get cov­ered in blood?” asked Sea­mus with great in­ter­est.

“I’ve nev­er asked,” said Near­ly Head­less Nick del­icate­ly.

When ev­ery­one had eat­en as much as they could, the re­mains of the food fad­ed from the plates, leav­ing them sparkling clean as be­fore. A mo­ment lat­er the desserts ap­peared. Blocks of ice cream in ev­ery fla­vor you could think of, ap­ple pies, trea­cle tarts, choco­late eclairs and jam dough­nuts, tri­fle, straw­ber­ries, Jell-​O, rice pud­ding…

As Har­ry helped him­self to a trea­cle tart, the talk turned to their fam­ilies.

“I’m half-​and-​half,” said Sea­mus. “Me dad’s a Mug­gle. Mom didn’t tell him she was a witch ’til af­ter they were mar­ried. Bit of a nasty shock for him.”

The oth­ers laughed.

“What about you, Neville?” said Ron.

“Well, my gran brought me up and she’s a witch,” said Neville, “but the fam­ily thought I was all-​Mug­gle for ages. My Great Un­cle Al­gie kept try­ing to catch me off my guard and force some mag­ic out of me — he pushed me off the end of Black­pool pier once, I near­ly drowned — but noth­ing hap­pened un­til I was eight. Great Un­cle Al­gie came round for din­ner, and he was hang­ing me out of an up­stairs win­dow by the an­kles when my Great Aun­tie Enid of­fered him a meringue and he ac­ci­den­tal­ly let go. But I bounced — all the way down the gar­den and in­to the road. They were all re­al­ly pleased, Gran was cry­ing, she was so hap­py. And you should have seen their faces when I got in here — they thought I might not be mag­ic enough to come, you see. Great Un­cle Al­gie was so pleased he bought me my toad.”

On Har­ry’s oth­er side, Per­cy Weasley and Hermione were talk­ing about lessons (“I do hope they start right away, there’s so much to learn, I’m par­tic­ular­ly in­ter­est­ed in Trans­fig­ura­tion, you know, turn­ing some­thing in­to some­thing else, of course, it’s sup­posed to be very dif­fi­cult —”; “You’ll be start­ing small, just match­es in­to nee­dles and that sort of thing — ”).

Har­ry, who was start­ing to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at the High Ta­ble again. Ha­grid was drink­ing deeply from his gob­let. Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall was talk­ing to Pro­fes­sor Dum­ble­dore. Pro­fes­sor Quir­rell, in his ab­surd tur­ban, was talk­ing to a teach­er with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sal­low skin.

It hap­pened very sud­den­ly. The hook-​nosed teach­er looked past Quir­rell’s tur­ban straight in­to Har­ry’s eyes — and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on Har­ry’s fore­head.

“Ouch!” Har­ry clapped a hand to his head.

“What is it?” asked Per­cy.

“N-​noth­ing.”

The pain had gone as quick­ly as it had come. Hard­er to shake off was the feel­ing Har­ry had got­ten from the teach­er’s look — a feel­ing that he didn’t like Har­ry at all.

“Who’s that teach­er talk­ing to Pro­fes­sor Quir­rell?” he asked Per­cy.

“Oh, you know Quir­rell al­ready, do you? No won­der he’s look­ing so ner­vous, that’s Pro­fes­sor Snape. He teach­es Po­tions, but he doesn’t want to — ev­ery­one knows he’s af­ter Quir­rell’s job. Knows an aw­ful lot about the Dark Arts, Snape.”

Har­ry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn’t look at him again.

At last, the desserts too dis­ap­peared, and Pro­fes­sor Dum­ble­dore got to his feet again. The hall fell silent.

“Ahem — just a few more words now that we are all fed and wa­tered. I have a few start-​of-​term no­tices to give you.

“First years should note that the for­est on the grounds is for­bid­den to all pupils. And a few of our old­er stu­dents would do well to re­mem­ber that as well.”

Dum­ble­dore’s twin­kling eyes flashed in the di­rec­tion of the Weasley twins.

“I have al­so been asked by Mr. Filch, the care­tak­er, to re­mind you all that no mag­ic should be used be­tween class­es in the cor­ri­dors.

“Quid­ditch tri­als will be held in the sec­ond week of the term. Any­one in­ter­est­ed in play­ing for their house teams should con­tact Madam Hooch.

“And fi­nal­ly, I must tell you that this year, the third-​floor cor­ri­dor on the right-​hand side is out of bounds to ev­ery­one who does not wish to die a very painful death.”

Har­ry laughed, but he was one of the few who did.

“He’s not se­ri­ous?” he mut­tered to Per­cy.

“Must be,” said Per­cy, frown­ing at Dum­ble­dore. “It’s odd, be­cause he usu­al­ly gives us a rea­son why we’re not al­lowed to go some­where — the for­est’s full of dan­ger­ous beasts, ev­ery­one knows that. I do think he might have told us pre­fects, at least.”

“And now, be­fore we go to bed, let us sing the school song!” cried Dum­ble­dore. Har­ry no­ticed that the oth­er teach­ers’ smiles had be­come rather fixed.

Dum­ble­dore gave his wand a lit­tle flick, as if he was try­ing to get a fly off the end, and a long gold­en rib­bon flew out of it, which rose high above the ta­bles and twist­ed it­self, snake­like, in­to words.

“Ev­ery­one pick their fa­vorite tune,” said Dum­ble­dore, “and off we go!”

And the school bel­lowed:

“Hog­warts, Hog­warts, Hog­gy Warty Hog­warts,

Teach us some­thing please,

Whether we be old and bald

Or young with scab­by knees,

Our heads could do with fill­ing

With some in­ter­est­ing stuff,

For now they’re bare and full of air,

Dead flies and bits of fluff,

So teach us things worth know­ing,

Bring back what we’ve for­got,

just do your best, we’ll do the rest,

And learn un­til our brains all rot.”



Ev­ery­body fin­ished the song at dif­fer­ent times. At last, on­ly the Weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow fu­ner­al march. Dum­ble­dore con­duct­ed their last few lines with his wand and when they had fin­ished, he was one of those who clapped loud­est.

“Ah, mu­sic,” he said, wip­ing his eyes. “A mag­ic be­yond all we do here! And now, bed­time. Off you trot!”

The Gryffind­or first years fol­lowed Per­cy through the chat­ter­ing crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the mar­ble stair­case. Har­ry’s legs were like lead again, but on­ly be­cause he was so tired and full of food. He was too sleepy even to be sur­prised that the peo­ple in the por­traits along the cor­ri­dors whis­pered and point­ed as they passed, or that twice Per­cy led them through door­ways hid­den be­hind slid­ing pan­els and hang­ing tapestries. They climbed more stair­cas­es, yawn­ing and drag­ging their feet, and Har­ry was just won­der­ing how much far­ther they had to go when they came to a sud­den halt.

A bun­dle of walk­ing sticks was float­ing in midair ahead of them, and as Per­cy took a step to­ward them they start­ed throw­ing them­selves at him.

“Peeves,” Per­cy whis­pered to the first years. “A poltergeist.” He raised his voice, “Peeves — show your­self.”

A loud, rude sound, like the air be­ing let out of a bal­loon, an­swered.

“Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?”

There was a pop, and a lit­tle man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide mouth ap­peared, float­ing cross-​legged in the air, clutch­ing the walk­ing sticks.

“Oooooooh!” he said, with an evil cack­le. “Ick­le Firsties! What fun!”

He swooped sud­den­ly at them. They all ducked.

“Go away, Peeves, or the Baron’ll hear about this, I mean it!” barked Per­cy.

Peeves stuck out his tongue and van­ished, drop­ping the walk­ing sticks on Neville’s head. They heard him zoom­ing away, rat­tling coats of ar­mor as he passed.

“You want to watch out for Peeves,” said Per­cy, as they set off again. “The Bloody Baron’s the on­ly one who can con­trol him, he won’t even lis­ten to us pre­fects. Here we are.”

At the very end of the cor­ri­dor hung a por­trait of a very fat wom­an in a pink silk dress.

“Pass­word?” she said.

“Ca­put Dra­co­nis,” said Per­cy, and the por­trait swung for­ward to re­veal a round hole in the wall. They all scram­bled through it — Neville need­ed a leg up — and found them­selves in the Gryffind­or com­mon room, a cozy, round room full of squashy arm­chairs.

Per­cy di­rect­ed the girls through one door to their dor­mi­to­ry and the boys through an­oth­er. At the top of a spi­ral stair­case — they were ob­vi­ous­ly in one of the tow­ers — they found their beds at last: five four-​posters hung with deep red, vel­vet cur­tains. Their trunks had al­ready been brought up. Too tired to talk much, they pulled on their pa­ja­mas and fell in­to bed.

“Great food, isn’t it?” Ron mut­tered to Har­ry through the hang­ings. “Get off, Scab­bers! He’s chew­ing my sheets.”

Har­ry was go­ing to ask Ron if he’d had any of the trea­cle tart, but he fell asleep al­most at once.

Per­haps Har­ry had eat­en a bit too much, be­cause he had a very strange dream. He was wear­ing Pro­fes­sor Quir­rell’s tur­ban, which kept talk­ing to him, telling him he must trans­fer to Slytherin at once, be­cause it was his des­tiny. Har­ry told the tur­ban he didn’t want to be in Slytherin; it got heav­ier and heav­ier; he tried to pull it off but it tight­ened painful­ly — and there was Mal­foy, laugh­ing at him as he strug­gled with it — then Mal­foy turned in­to the hook-​nosed teach­er, Snape, whose laugh be­came high and cold — there was a burst of green light and Har­ry woke, sweat­ing and shak­ing.

He rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he woke next day, he didn’t re­mem­ber the dream at all.

CHAPTER EIGHT




THE PO­TIONS MAS­TER



T here, look.”

“Where?”

“Next to the tall kid with the red hair.”

“Wear­ing the glass­es?”

“Did you see his face?”

“Did you see his scar?”

Whis­pers fol­lowed Har­ry from the mo­ment he left his dor­mi­to­ry the next day. Peo­ple lin­ing up out­side class­rooms stood on tip­toe to get a look at him, or dou­bled back to pass him in the cor­ri­dors again, star­ing. Har­ry wished they wouldn’t, be­cause he was try­ing to con­cen­trate on find­ing his way to class­es.

There were a hun­dred and forty-​two stair­cas­es at Hog­warts: wide, sweep­ing ones; nar­row, rick­ety ones; some that led some­where dif­fer­ent on a Fri­day; some with a van­ish­ing step halfway up that you had to re­mem­ber to jump. Then there were doors that wouldn’t open un­less you asked po­lite­ly, or tick­led them in ex­act­ly the right place, and doors that weren’t re­al­ly doors at all, but sol­id walls just pre­tend­ing. It was al­so very hard to re­mem­ber where any­thing was, be­cause it all seemed to move around a lot. The peo­ple in the por­traits kept go­ing to vis­it each oth­er, and Har­ry was sure the coats of ar­mor could walk.

The ghosts didn’t help, ei­ther. It was al­ways a nasty shock when one of them glid­ed sud­den­ly through a door you were try­ing to open. Near­ly Head­less Nick was al­ways hap­py to point new Gryffind­ors in the right di­rec­tion, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick stair­case if you met him when you were late for class. He would drop wastepa­per bas­kets on your head, pull rugs from un­der your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak up be­hind you, in­vis­ible, grab your nose, and screech, “GOT YOUR CONK!”

Even worse than Peeves, if that was pos­si­ble, was the care­tak­er, Ar­gus Filch. Har­ry and Ron man­aged to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morn­ing. Filch found them try­ing to force their way through a door that un­luck­ily turned out to be the en­trance to the out-​of-​bounds cor­ri­dor on the third floor. He wouldn’t be­lieve they were lost, was sure they were try­ing to break in­to it on pur­pose, and was threat­en­ing to lock them in the dun­geons when they were res­cued by Pro­fes­sor Quir­rell, who was pass­ing.

Filch owned a cat called Mrs. Nor­ris, a scrawny, dust-​col­ored crea­ture with bulging, lamp like eyes just like Filch’s. She pa­trolled the cor­ri­dors alone. Break a rule in front of her, put just one toe out of line, and she’d whisk off for Filch, who’d ap­pear, wheez­ing, two sec­onds lat­er. Filch knew the se­cret pas­sage­ways of the school bet­ter than any­one (ex­cept per­haps the Weasley twins) and could pop up as sud­den­ly as any of the ghosts. The stu­dents all hat­ed him, and it was the dear­est am­bi­tion of many to give Mrs. Nor­ris a good kick.

And then, once you had man­aged to find them, there were the class­es them­selves. There was a lot more to mag­ic, as Har­ry quick­ly found out, than wav­ing your wand and say­ing a few fun­ny words.

They had to study the night skies through their tele­scopes ev­ery Wednes­day at mid­night and learn the names of dif­fer­ent stars and the move­ments of the plan­ets. Three times a week they went out to the green­hous­es be­hind the cas­tle to study Her­bol­ogy, with a dumpy lit­tle witch called Pro­fes­sor Sprout, where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fun­gi, and found out what they were used for. Eas­ily the most bor­ing class was His­to­ry of Mag­ic, which was the on­ly one taught by a ghost. Pro­fes­sor Binns had been very old in­deed when he had fall­en asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morn­ing to teach, leav­ing his body be­hind him. Binns droned on and on while they scrib­bled down names and dates, and got Emet­ic the Evil and Uric the Odd­ball mixed up.

Pro­fes­sor Flitwick, the Charms teach­er, was a tiny lit­tle wiz­ard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start of their first class he took the roll call, and when he reached Har­ry’s name he gave an ex­cit­ed squeak and top­pled out of sight.

Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall was again dif­fer­ent. Har­ry had been quite right to think she wasn’t a teach­er to cross. Strict and clever, she gave them a talk­ing-​to the mo­ment they sat down in her first class.

“Trans­fig­ura­tion is some of the most com­plex and dan­ger­ous mag­ic you will learn at Hog­warts,” she said. “Any­one mess­ing around in my class will leave and not come back. You have been warned.”

Then she changed her desk in­to a pig and back again. They were all very im­pressed and couldn’t wait to get start­ed, but soon re­al­ized they weren’t go­ing to be chang­ing the fur­ni­ture in­to an­imals for a long time. Af­ter tak­ing a lot of com­pli­cat­ed notes, they were each giv­en a match and start­ed try­ing to turn it in­to a nee­dle. By the end of the les­son, on­ly Hermione Granger had made any dif­fer­ence to her match; Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall showed the class how it had gone all sil­ver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare smile.

The class ev­ery­one had re­al­ly been look­ing for­ward to was De­fense Against the Dark Arts, but Quir­rell’s lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke. His class­room smelled strong­ly of gar­lic, which ev­ery­one said was to ward off a vam­pire he’d met in Ro­ma­nia and was afraid would be com­ing back to get him one of these days. His tur­ban, he told them, had been giv­en to him by an African prince as a thank-​you for get­ting rid of a trou­ble­some zom­bie, but they weren’t sure they be­lieved this sto­ry. For one thing, when Sea­mus Finni­gan asked ea­ger­ly to hear how Quir­rell had fought off the zom­bie, Quir­rell went pink and start­ed talk­ing about the weath­er; for an­oth­er, they had no­ticed that a fun­ny smell hung around the tur­ban, and the Weasley twins in­sist­ed that it was stuffed full of gar­lic as well, so that Quir­rell was pro­tect­ed wher­ev­er he went.

Har­ry was very re­lieved to find out that he wasn’t miles be­hind ev­ery­one else. Lots of peo­ple had come from Mug­gle fam­ilies and, like him, hadn’t had any idea that they were witch­es and wiz­ards. There was so much to learn that even peo­ple like Ron didn’t have much of a head start.

Fri­day was an im­por­tant day for Har­ry and Ron. They fi­nal­ly man­aged to find their way down to the Great Hall for break­fast with­out get­ting lost once.

“What have we got to­day?” Har­ry asked Ron as he poured sug­ar on his por­ridge.

“Dou­ble Po­tions with the Slytherins,” said Ron. “Snape’s Head of Slytherin House. They say he al­ways fa­vors them — we’ll be able to see if it’s true.”

“Wish McG­ona­gall fa­vored us,” said Har­ry. Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall was head of Gryffind­or House, but it hadn’t stopped her from giv­ing them a huge pile of home­work the day be­fore.

Just then, the mail ar­rived. Har­ry had got­ten used to this by now, but it had giv­en him a bit of a shock on the first morn­ing, when about a hun­dred owls had sud­den­ly streamed in­to the Great Hall dur­ing break­fast, cir­cling the ta­bles un­til they saw their own­ers, and drop­ping let­ters and pack­ages on­to their laps.

Hed­wig hadn’t brought Har­ry any­thing so far. She some­times flew in to nib­ble his ear and have a bit of toast be­fore go­ing off to sleep in the owlery with the oth­er school owls. This morn­ing, how­ev­er, she flut­tered down be­tween the mar­malade and the sug­ar bowl and dropped a note on­to Har­ry’s plate. Har­ry tore it open at once. It said, in a very un­tidy scrawl:



Dear Har­ry,

I know you get Fri­day af­ter­noons off, so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three?

I want to hear all about your first week. Send us an an­swer back with Hed­wig.

Ha­grid



Har­ry bor­rowed Ron’s quill, scrib­bled Yes, please, see you lat­er on the back of the note, and sent Hed­wig off again.

It was lucky that Har­ry had tea with Ha­grid to look for­ward to, be­cause the Po­tions les­son turned out to be the worst thing that had hap­pened to him so far.

At the start-​of-​term ban­quet, Har­ry had got­ten the idea that Pro­fes­sor Snape dis­liked him. By the end of the first Po­tions les­son, he knew he’d been wrong. Snape didn’t dis­like Har­ry — he hat­ed him.

Po­tions lessons took place down in one of the dun­geons. It was cold­er here than up in the main cas­tle, and would have been quite creepy enough with­out the pick­led an­imals float­ing in glass jars all around the walls.

Snape, like Flitwick, start­ed the class by tak­ing the roll call, and like Flitwick, he paused at Har­ry’s name.

“Ah, Yes,” he said soft­ly, “Har­ry Pot­ter. Our new — celebri­ty.”

Dra­co Mal­foy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle snig­gered be­hind their hands. Snape fin­ished call­ing the names and looked up at the class. His eyes were black like Ha­grid’s, but they had none of Ha­grid’s warmth. They were cold and emp­ty and made you think of dark tun­nels.

“You are here to learn the sub­tle sci­ence and ex­act art of po­tion­mak­ing,” he be­gan. He spoke in bare­ly more than a whis­per, but they caught ev­ery word — like Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall, Snape had the gift of keep­ing a class silent with­out ef­fort. “As there is lit­tle fool­ish wand-​wav­ing here, many of you will hard­ly be­lieve this is mag­ic. I don’t ex­pect you will re­al­ly un­der­stand the beau­ty of the soft­ly sim­mer­ing caul­dron with its shim­mer­ing fumes, the del­icate pow­er of liq­uids that creep through hu­man veins, be­witch­ing the mind, en­snar­ing the sens­es.…I can teach you how to bot­tle fame, brew glo­ry, even stop­per death — if you aren’t as big a bunch of dun­der­heads as I usu­al­ly have to teach.”

More si­lence fol­lowed this lit­tle speech. Har­ry and Ron ex­changed looks with raised eye­brows. Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and looked des­per­ate to start prov­ing that she wasn’t a dun­der­head.

“Pot­ter!” said Snape sud­den­ly. “What would I get if I added pow­dered root of as­pho­del to an in­fu­sion of worm­wood?”

Pow­dered root of what to an in­fu­sion of what? Har­ry glanced at Ron, who looked as stumped as he was; Hermione’s hand had shot in­to the air.

“I don’t know, sir,” said Har­ry.

Snape’s lips curled in­to a sneer.

“Tut, tut — fame clear­ly isn’t ev­ery­thing.”

He ig­nored Hermione’s hand.

“Let’s try again. Pot­ter, where would you look if I told you to find me a be­zoar?”

Hermione stretched her hand as high in­to the air as it would go with­out her leav­ing her seat, but Har­ry didn’t have the faintest idea what a be­zoar was. He tried not to look at Mal­foy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were shak­ing with laugh­ter.

“I don’t know, sir.”

“Thought you wouldn’t open a book be­fore com­ing, eh, Pot­ter?” Har­ry forced him­self to keep look­ing straight in­to those cold eyes. He had looked through his books at the Durs­leys’, but did Snape ex­pect him to re­mem­ber ev­ery­thing in One Thou­sand Mag­ical Herbs and Fun­gi?

Snape was still ig­nor­ing Hermione’s quiv­er­ing hand.

“What is the dif­fer­ence, Pot­ter, be­tween monks­hood and wolfs­bane?”

At this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretch­ing to­ward the dun­geon ceil­ing.

“I don’t know,” said Har­ry qui­et­ly. “I think Hermione does, though, why don’t you try her?”

A few peo­ple laughed; Har­ry caught Sea­mus’s eye, and Sea­mus winked. Snape, how­ev­er, was not pleased.

“Sit down,” he snapped at Hermione. “For your in­for­ma­tion, Pot­ter, as­pho­del and worm­wood make a sleep­ing po­tion so pow­er­ful it is known as the Draught of Liv­ing Death. A be­zoar is a stone tak­en from the stom­ach of a goat and it will save you from most poi­sons. As for monks­hood and wolfs­bane, they are the same plant, which al­so goes by the name of aconite. Well? Why aren’t you all copy­ing that down?”

There was a sud­den rum­mag­ing for quills and parch­ment. Over the noise, Snape said, “And a point will be tak­en from Gryffind­or House for your cheek, Pot­ter.”

Things didn’t im­prove for the Gryffind­ors as the Po­tions les­son con­tin­ued. Snape put them all in­to pairs and set them to mix­ing up a sim­ple po­tion to cure boils. He swept around in his long black cloak, watch­ing them weigh dried net­tles and crush snake fangs, crit­iciz­ing al­most ev­ery­one ex­cept Mal­foy, whom he seemed to like. He was just telling ev­ery­one to look at the per­fect way Mal­foy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hiss­ing filled the dun­geon. Neville had some­how man­aged to melt Sea­mus’s caul­dron in­to a twist­ed blob, and their po­tion was seep­ing across the stone floor, burn­ing holes in peo­ple’s shoes. With­in sec­onds, the whole class was stand­ing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in the po­tion when the caul­dron col­lapsed, moaned in pain as an­gry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs.

“Id­iot boy!” snarled Snape, clear­ing the spilled po­tion away with one wave of his wand. “I sup­pose you added the por­cu­pine quills be­fore tak­ing the caul­dron off the fire?”

Neville whim­pered as boils start­ed to pop up all over his nose.

“Take him up to the hos­pi­tal wing,” Snape spat at Sea­mus. Then he round­ed on Har­ry and Ron, who had been work­ing next to Neville.

“You — Pot­ter — why didn’t you tell him not to add the quills? Thought he’d make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? That’s an­oth­er point you’ve lost for Gryffind­or.”

This was so un­fair that Har­ry opened his mouth to ar­gue, but Ron kicked him be­hind their caul­dron.

“Don’t push it,” he mut­tered, “I’ve heard Snape can turn very nasty.”

As they climbed the steps out of the dun­geon an hour lat­er, Har­ry’s mind was rac­ing and his spir­its were low. He’d lost two points for Gryffind­or in his very first week — why did Snape hate him so much?

“Cheer up,” said Ron, “Snape’s al­ways tak­ing points off Fred and George. Can I come and meet Ha­grid with you?”

At five to three they left the cas­tle and made their way across the grounds. Ha­grid lived in a small wood­en house on the edge of the for­bid­den for­est. A cross­bow and a pair of ga­losh­es were out­side the front door.

When Har­ry knocked they heard a fran­tic scrab­bling from in­side and sev­er­al boom­ing barks. Then Ha­grid’s voice rang out, say­ing, “Back, Fang — back.”

Ha­grid’s big, hairy face ap­peared in the crack as he pulled the door open.

“Hang on,” he said. “Back, Fang.”

He let them in, strug­gling to keep a hold on the col­lar of an enor­mous black boarhound.

There was on­ly one room in­side. Hams and pheas­ants were hang­ing from the ceil­ing, a cop­per ket­tle was boil­ing on the open fire, and in the cor­ner stood a mas­sive bed with a patch­work quilt over it.

“Make yer­selves at home,” said Ha­grid, let­ting go of Fang, who bound­ed straight at Ron and start­ed lick­ing his ears. Like Ha­grid, Fang was clear­ly not as fierce as he looked.

“This is Ron,” Har­ry told Ha­grid, who was pour­ing boil­ing wa­ter in­to a large teapot and putting rock cakes on­to a plate.

“An­oth­er Weasley, eh?” said Ha­grid, glanc­ing at Ron’s freck­les. I spent half me life chasin’ yer twin broth­ers away from the for­est.”

The rock cakes were shape­less lumps with raisins that al­most broke their teeth, but Har­ry and Ron pre­tend­ed to be en­joy­ing them as they told Ha­grid all about their first lessons. Fang rest­ed his head on Har­ry’s knee and drooled all over his robes.

Har­ry and Ron were de­light­ed to hear Ha­grid call Filch “that old git.”

“An’ as fer that cat, Mrs. Nor­ris, I’d like ter in­tro­duce her to Fang some­time. D’yeh know, ev­ery time I go up ter the school, she fol­lows me ev­ery­where? Can’t get rid of her — Filch puts her up to it.”

Har­ry told Ha­grid about Snape’s les­son. Ha­grid, like Ron, told Har­ry not to wor­ry about it, that Snape liked hard­ly any of the stu­dents.

“But he seemed to re­al­ly hate me.”

“Rub­bish!” said Ha­grid. “Why should he?”

Yet Har­ry couldn’t help think­ing that Ha­grid didn’t quite meet his eyes when he said that.

“How’s yer broth­er Char­lie?” Ha­grid asked Ron. “I liked him a lot — great with an­imals.”

Har­ry won­dered if Ha­grid had changed the sub­ject on pur­pose. While Ron told Ha­grid all about Char­lie’s work with drag­ons, Har­ry picked up a piece of pa­per that was ly­ing on the ta­ble un­der the tea cozy. It was a cut­ting from the Dai­ly Prophet:



GRINGOTTS BREAK-​IN LAT­EST

In­ves­ti­ga­tions con­tin­ue in­to the break-​in at Gringotts on 31 Ju­ly, wide­ly be­lieved to be the work of Dark wiz­ards or witch­es un­known.

Gringotts gob­lins to­day in­sist­ed that noth­ing had been tak­en. The vault that was searched had in fact been emp­tied the same day.

“But we’re not telling you what was in there, so keep your noses out if you know what’s good for you,” said a Gringotts spokesgob­lin this af­ter­noon.



Har­ry re­mem­bered Ron telling him on the train that some­one had tried to rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn’t men­tioned the date.

“Ha­grid!” said Har­ry, “that Gringotts break-​in hap­pened on my birth­day! It might’ve been hap­pen­ing while we were there!”

There was no doubt about it, Ha­grid def­inite­ly didn’t meet Har­ry’s eyes this time. He grunt­ed and of­fered him an­oth­er rock cake. Har­ry read the sto­ry again. The vault that was searched had in fact been emp­tied ear­li­er that same day. Ha­grid had emp­tied vault sev­en hun­dred and thir­teen, if you could call it emp­ty­ing, tak­ing out that grub­by lit­tle pack­age. Had that been what the thieves were look­ing for?

As Har­ry and Ron walked back to the cas­tle for din­ner, their pock­ets weighed down with rock cakes they’d been too po­lite to refuse, Har­ry thought that none of the lessons he’d had so far had giv­en him as much to think about as tea with Ha­grid. Had Ha­grid col­lect­ed that pack­age just in time? Where was it now? And did Ha­grid know some­thing about Snape that he didn’t want to tell Har­ry?





HP 1 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone





CHAPTER NINE




THE MID­NIGHT DU­EL



H ar­ry had nev­er be­lieved he would meet a boy he hat­ed more than Dud­ley, but that was be­fore he met Dra­co Mal­foy. Still, first-​year Gryffind­ors on­ly had Po­tions with the Slytherins, so they didn’t have to put up with Mal­foy much. Or at least, they didn’t un­til they spot­ted a no­tice pinned up in the Gryffind­or com­mon room that made them all groan. Fly­ing lessons would be start­ing on Thurs­day — and Gryffind­or and Slytherin would be learn­ing to­geth­er.

“Typ­ical,” said Har­ry dark­ly. “Just what I al­ways want­ed. To make a fool of my­self on a broom­stick in front of Mal­foy.”

He had been look­ing for­ward to learn­ing to fly more than any­thing else.

“You don’t know that you’ll make a fool of your­self,” said Ron rea­son­ably. “Any­way, I know Mal­foy’s al­ways go­ing on about how good he is at Quid­ditch, but I bet that’s all talk.”

Mal­foy cer­tain­ly did talk about fly­ing a lot. He com­plained loud­ly about first years nev­er get­ting on the house Quid­ditch teams and told long, boast­ful sto­ries that al­ways seemed to end with him nar­row­ly es­cap­ing Mug­gles in he­li­copters. He wasn’t the on­ly one, though: the way Sea­mus Finni­gan told it, he’d spent most of his child­hood zoom­ing around the coun­try­side on his broom­stick. Even Ron would tell any­one who’d lis­ten about the time he’d al­most hit a hang glid­er on Char­lie’s old broom. Ev­ery­one from wiz­ard­ing fam­ilies talked about Quid­ditch con­stant­ly. Ron had al­ready had a big ar­gu­ment with Dean Thomas, who shared their dor­mi­to­ry, about soc­cer. Ron couldn’t see what was ex­cit­ing about a game with on­ly one ball where no one was al­lowed to fly. Har­ry had caught Ron prod­ding Dean’s poster of West Ham soc­cer team, try­ing to make the play­ers move.

Neville had nev­er been on a broom­stick in his life, be­cause his grand­moth­er had nev­er let him near one. Pri­vate­ly, Har­ry felt she’d had good rea­son, be­cause Neville man­aged to have an ex­traor­di­nary num­ber of ac­ci­dents even with both feet on the ground.

Hermione Granger was al­most as ner­vous about fly­ing as Neville was. This was some­thing you couldn’t learn by heart out of a book — not that she hadn’t tried. At break­fast on Thurs­day she bored them all stupid with fly­ing tips she’d got­ten out of a li­brary book called Quid­ditch Through the Ages. Neville was hang­ing on to her ev­ery word, des­per­ate for any­thing that might help him hang on to his broom­stick lat­er, but ev­ery­body else was very pleased when Hermione’s lec­ture was in­ter­rupt­ed by the ar­rival of the mail.

Har­ry hadn’t had a sin­gle let­ter since Ha­grid’s note, some­thing that Mal­foy had been quick to no­tice, of course. Mal­foy’s ea­gle owl was al­ways bring­ing him pack­ages of sweets from home, which he opened gloat­ing­ly at the Slytherin ta­ble.

A barn owl brought Neville a small pack­age from his grand­moth­er. He opened it ex­cit­ed­ly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large mar­ble, which seemed to be full of white smoke.

“It’s a Re­mem­brall!” he ex­plained. “Gran knows I for­get things — this tells you if there’s some­thing you’ve for­got­ten to do. Look, you hold it tight like this and if it turns red — oh…” His face fell, be­cause the Re­mem­brall had sud­den­ly glowed scar­let, “…you’ve for­got­ten some­thing….”

Neville was try­ing to re­mem­ber what he’d for­got­ten when Dra­co Mal­foy, who was pass­ing the Gryffind­or ta­ble, snatched the Re­mem­brall out of his hand.

Har­ry and Ron jumped to their feet. They were half hop­ing for a rea­son to fight Mal­foy, but Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall, who could spot trou­ble quick­er than any teach­er in the school, was there in a flash.

“What’s go­ing on?”

“Mal­foy’s got my Re­mem­brall, Pro­fes­sor.”

Scowl­ing, Mal­foy quick­ly dropped the Re­mem­brall back on the ta­ble.

“Just look­ing,” he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle be­hind him.



At three-​thir­ty that af­ter­noon, Har­ry, Ron, and the oth­er Gryffind­ors hur­ried down the front steps on­to the grounds for their first fly­ing les­son. It was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rip­pled un­der their feet as they marched down the slop­ing lawns to­ward a smooth, flat lawn on the op­po­site side of the grounds to the for­bid­den for­est, whose trees were sway­ing dark­ly in the dis­tance.

The Slytherins were al­ready there, and so were twen­ty broom­sticks ly­ing in neat lines on the ground. Har­ry had heard Fred and George Weasley com­plain about the school brooms, say­ing that some of them start­ed to vi­brate if you flew too high, or al­ways flew slight­ly to the left.

Their teach­er, Madam Hooch, ar­rived. She had short, gray hair, and yel­low eyes like a hawk.

“Well, what are you all wait­ing for?” she barked. “Ev­ery­one stand by a broom­stick. Come on, hur­ry up.”

Har­ry glanced down at his broom. It was old and some of the twigs stuck out at odd an­gles.

“Stick out your right hand over your broom,” called Madam Hooch at the front, “and say ‘Up!’”

“UP” ev­ery­one shout­ed.

Har­ry’s broom jumped in­to his hand at once, but it was one of the few that did. Hermione Granger’s had sim­ply rolled over on the ground, and Neville’s hadn’t moved at all. Per­haps brooms, like hors­es, could tell when you were afraid, thought Har­ry; there was a qua­ver in Neville’s voice that said on­ly too clear­ly that he want­ed to keep his feet on the ground.

Madam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms with­out slid­ing off the end, and walked up and down the rows cor­rect­ing their grips. Har­ry and Ron were de­light­ed when she told Mal­foy he’d been do­ing it wrong for years.

“Now, when I blow my whis­tle, you kick off from the ground, hard,” said Madam Hooch. “Keep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come straight back down by lean­ing for­ward slight­ly. On my whis­tle — three — two —”

But Neville, ner­vous and jumpy and fright­ened of be­ing left on the ground, pushed off hard be­fore the whis­tle had touched Madam Hooch’s lips.

“Come back, boy!” she shout­ed, but Neville was ris­ing straight up like a cork shot out of a bot­tle — twelve feet — twen­ty feet. Har­ry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp, slip side­ways off the broom and —

WHAM — a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay face­down on the grass in a heap. His broom­stick was still ris­ing high­er and high­er, and start­ed to drift lazi­ly to­ward the for­bid­den for­est and out of sight.

Madam Hooch was bend­ing over Neville, her face as white as his.

“Bro­ken wrist,” Har­ry heard her mut­ter. “Come on, boy — it’s all right, up you get.”

She turned to the rest of the class.

“None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hos­pi­tal wing! You leave those brooms where they are or you’ll be out of Hog­warts be­fore you can say ‘Quid­ditch.’ Come on, dear.”

Neville, his face tear-​streaked, clutch­ing his wrist, hob­bled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm around him.

No soon­er were they out of earshot than Mal­foy burst in­to laugh­ter.

“Did you see his face, the great lump?”

The oth­er Slytherins joined in.

“Shut up, Mal­foy,” snapped Par­vati Patil.

“Ooh, stick­ing up for Long­bot­tom?” said Pan­sy Parkin­son, a hard-​faced Slytherin girl. “Nev­er thought you’d like fat lit­tle cry­ba­bies, Par­vati.”

“Look!” said Mal­foy, dart­ing for­ward and snatch­ing some­thing out of the grass. “It’s that stupid thing Long­bot­tom’s gran sent him.”

The Re­mem­brall glit­tered in the sun as he held it up.

“Give that here, Mal­foy,” said Har­ry qui­et­ly. Ev­ery­one stopped talk­ing to watch.

Mal­foy smiled nas­ti­ly.

“I think I’ll leave it some­where for Long­bot­tom to find — how about — up a tree?”

“Give it here!” Har­ry yelled, but Mal­foy had leapt on­to his broom­stick and tak­en off. He hadn’t been ly­ing, he could fly well. Hov­er­ing lev­el with the top­most branch­es of an oak he called, “Come and get it, Pot­ter!”

Har­ry grabbed his broom.

“No!” shout­ed Hermione Granger. “Madam Hooch told us not to move — you’ll get us all in­to trou­ble.”

Har­ry ig­nored her. Blood was pound­ing in his ears. He mount­ed the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared; air rushed through his hair, and his robes whipped out be­hind him — and in a rush of fierce joy he re­al­ized he’d found some­thing he could do with­out be­ing taught — this was easy, this was won­der­ful. He pulled his broom­stick up a lit­tle to take it even high­er, and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an ad­mir­ing whoop from Ron.

He turned his broom­stick sharply to face Mal­foy in midair. Mal­foy looked stunned.

“Give it here,” Har­ry called, “or I’ll knock you off that broom!”

“Oh, yeah?” said Mal­foy, try­ing to sneer, but look­ing wor­ried.

Har­ry knew, some­how, what to do. He leaned for­ward and grasped the broom tight­ly in both hands, and it shot to­ward Mal­foy like a javelin. Mal­foy on­ly just got out of the way in time; Har­ry made a sharp about-​face and held the broom steady. A few peo­ple be­low were clap­ping.

“No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Mal­foy,” Har­ry called.

The same thought seemed to have struck Mal­foy.

“Catch it if you can, then!” he shout­ed, and he threw the glass ball high in­to the air and streaked back to­ward the ground.

Har­ry saw, as though in slow mo­tion, the ball rise up in the air and then start to fall. He leaned for­ward and point­ed his broom han­dle down — next sec­ond he was gath­er­ing speed in a steep dive, rac­ing the ball — wind whis­tled in his ears, min­gled with the screams of peo­ple watch­ing — he stretched out his hand — a foot from the ground he caught it, just in time to pull his broom straight, and he top­pled gen­tly on­to the grass with the Re­mem­brall clutched safe­ly in his fist.

“HAR­RY POT­TER!”

His heart sank faster than he’d just dived. Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall was run­ning to­ward them. He got to his feet, trem­bling.

“Nev­er — in all my time at Hog­warts —”

Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall was al­most speech­less with shock, and her glass­es flashed fu­ri­ous­ly, “— how dare you — might have bro­ken your neck —”

“It wasn’t his fault, Pro­fes­sor —”

“Be qui­et, Miss Patil —”

“But Mal­foy —”

“That’s enough, Mr. Weasley. Pot­ter, fol­low me, now.”

Har­ry caught sight of Mal­foy, Crabbe, and Goyle’s tri­umphant faces as he left, walk­ing numbly in Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall’s wake as she strode to­ward the cas­tle. He was go­ing to be ex­pelled, he just knew it. He want­ed to say some­thing to de­fend him­self, but there seemed to be some­thing wrong with his voice. Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall was sweep­ing along with­out even look­ing at him; he had to jog to keep up. Now he’d done it. He hadn’t even last­ed two weeks. He’d be pack­ing his bags in ten min­utes. What would the Durs­leys say when he turned up on the doorstep?

Up the front steps, up the mar­ble stair­case in­side, and still Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall didn’t say a word to him. She wrenched open doors and marched along cor­ri­dors with Har­ry trot­ting mis­er­ably be­hind her. Maybe she was tak­ing him to Dum­ble­dore. He thought of Ha­grid, ex­pelled but al­lowed to stay on as game­keep­er. Per­haps he could be Ha­grid’s as­sis­tant. His stom­ach twist­ed as he imag­ined it, watch­ing Ron and the oth­ers be­com­ing wiz­ards, while he stumped around the grounds car­ry­ing Ha­grid’s bag.

Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall stopped out­side a class­room. She opened the door and poked her head in­side.

“Ex­cuse me, Pro­fes­sor Flitwick, could I bor­row Wood for a mo­ment?”

Wood? thought Har­ry, be­wil­dered; was Wood a cane she was go­ing to use on him?

But Wood turned out to be a per­son, a burly fifth-​year boy who came out of Flitwick’s class look­ing con­fused.

“Fol­low me, you two,” said Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall, and they marched on up the cor­ri­dor, Wood look­ing cu­ri­ous­ly at Har­ry.

“In here.”

Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall point­ed them in­to a class­room that was emp­ty ex­cept for Peeves, who was busy writ­ing rude words on the black­board.

“Out, Peeves!” she barked. Peeves threw the chalk in­to a bin, which clanged loud­ly, and he swooped out curs­ing. Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall slammed the door be­hind him and turned to face the two boys.

“Pot­ter, this is Oliv­er Wood. Wood — I’ve found you a Seek­er.”

Wood’s ex­pres­sion changed from puz­zle­ment to de­light.

“Are you se­ri­ous, Pro­fes­sor?”

“Ab­so­lute­ly,” said Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall crisply. “The boy’s a nat­ural. I’ve nev­er seen any­thing like it. Was that your first time on a broom­stick, Pot­ter?”

Har­ry nod­ded silent­ly. He didn’t have a clue what was go­ing on, but he didn’t seem to be be­ing ex­pelled, and some of the feel­ing start­ed com­ing back to his legs.

“He caught that thing in his hand af­ter a fifty-​foot dive,” Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall told Wood. “Didn’t even scratch him­self. Char­lie Weasley couldn’t have done it.”

Wood was now look­ing as though all his dreams had come true at once.

“Ev­er seen a game of Quid­ditch, Pot­ter?” he asked ex­cit­ed­ly.

“Wood’s cap­tain of the Gryffind­or team,” Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall ex­plained.

“He’s just the build for a Seek­er, too,” said Wood, now walk­ing around Har­ry and star­ing at him. “Light —speedy — we’ll have to get him a de­cent broom, Pro­fes­sor — a Nim­bus Two Thou­sand or a Clean­sweep Sev­en, I’d say.”

“I shall speak to Pro­fes­sor Dum­ble­dore and see if we can’t bend the first-​year rule. Heav­en knows, we need a bet­ter team than last year. Flat­tened in that last match by Slytherin, I couldn’t look Severus Snape in the face for weeks.…”

Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall peered stern­ly over her glass­es at Har­ry.

“I want to hear you’re train­ing hard, Pot­ter, or I may change my mind about pun­ish­ing you.”

Then she sud­den­ly smiled.

“Your fa­ther would have been proud,” she said. “He was an ex­cel­lent Quid­ditch play­er him­self.”



“You’re jok­ing.”

It was din­ner­time. Har­ry had just fin­ished telling Ron what had hap­pened when he’d left the grounds with Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall. Ron had a piece of steak and kid­ney pie halfway to his mouth, but he’d for­got­ten all about it.

“Seek­er?” he said. “But first years nev­er — you must be the youngest house play­er in about —”

“ — a cen­tu­ry,” said Har­ry, shov­el­ing pie in­to his mouth. He felt par­tic­ular­ly hun­gry af­ter the ex­cite­ment of the af­ter­noon. “Wood told me.”

Ron was so amazed, so im­pressed, he just sat and gaped at Har­ry.

“I start train­ing next week,” said Har­ry. “On­ly don’t tell any­one, Wood wants to keep it a se­cret.”

Fred and George Weasley now came in­to the hall, spot­ted Har­ry, and hur­ried over.

“Well done,” said George in a low voice. “Wood told us. We’re on the team too — Beat­ers.”

“I tell you, we’re go­ing to win that Quid­ditch cup for sure this year,” said Fred. “We haven’t won since Char­lie left, but this year’s team is go­ing to be bril­liant. You must be good, Har­ry, Wood was al­most skip­ping when he told us.”

“Any­way, we’ve got to go, Lee Jor­dan reck­ons he’s found a new se­cret pas­sage­way out of the school.”

“Bet it’s that one be­hind the stat­ue of Gre­go­ry the Smarmy that we found in our first week. See you.”

Fred and George had hard­ly dis­ap­peared when some­one far less wel­come turned up: Mal­foy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle.

“Hav­ing a last meal, Pot­ter? When are you get­ting the train back to the Mug­gles?”

“You’re a lot braver now that you’re back on the ground and you’ve got your lit­tle friends with you,” said Har­ry cool­ly. There was of course noth­ing at all lit­tle about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Ta­ble was full of teach­ers, nei­ther of them could do more than crack their knuck­les and scowl.

“I’d take you on any­time on my own,” said Mal­foy. “Tonight, if you want. Wiz­ard’s du­el. Wands on­ly — no con­tact. What’s the mat­ter? Nev­er heard of a wiz­ard’s du­el be­fore, I sup­pose?”

“Of course he has,” said Ron, wheel­ing around. “I’m his sec­ond, who’s yours?”

Mal­foy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, siz­ing them up.

“Crabbe,” he said. “Mid­night all right? We’ll meet you in the tro­phy room; that’s al­ways un­locked.”

When Mal­foy had gone, Ron and Har­ry looked at each oth­er.

“What is a wiz­ard’s du­el?” said Har­ry. “And what do you mean, you’re my sec­ond?”

“Well, a sec­ond’s there to take over if you die,” said Ron ca­su­al­ly, get­ting start­ed at last on his cold pie. Catch­ing the look on Har­ry’s face, he added quick­ly, “But peo­ple on­ly die in prop­er du­els, you know, with re­al wiz­ards. The most you and Mal­foy’ll be able to do is send sparks at each oth­er. Nei­ther of you knows enough mag­ic to do any re­al dam­age. I bet he ex­pect­ed you to refuse, any­way.”

“And what if I wave my wand and noth­ing hap­pens?”

“Throw it away and punch him on the nose,” Ron sug­gest­ed.

“Ex­cuse me.”

They both looked up. It was Hermione Granger.

“Can’t a per­son eat in peace in this place?” said Ron.

Hermione ig­nored him and spoke to Har­ry.

“I couldn’t help over­hear­ing what you and Mal­foy were say­ing —”

“Bet you could,” Ron mut­tered.

“— and you mustn’t go wan­der­ing around the school at night, think of the points you’ll lose Gryffind­or if you’re caught, and you’re bound to be. It’s re­al­ly very self­ish of you.”

“And it’s re­al­ly none of your busi­ness,” said Har­ry.

“Good-​bye,” said Ron.



All the same, it wasn’t what you’d call the per­fect end to the day, Har­ry thought, as he lay awake much lat­er lis­ten­ing to Dean and Sea­mus falling asleep (Neville wasn’t back from the hos­pi­tal wing). Ron had spent all evening giv­ing him ad­vice such as “If he tries to curse you, you’d bet­ter dodge it, be­cause I can’t re­mem­ber how to block them.” There was a very good chance they were go­ing to get caught by Filch or Mrs. Nor­ris, and Har­ry felt he was push­ing his luck, break­ing an­oth­er school rule to­day. On the oth­er hand, Mal­foy’s sneer­ing face kept loom­ing up out of the dark­ness — this was his big chance to beat Mal­foy face-​to-​face. He couldn’t miss it.

“Half-​past eleven,” Ron mut­tered at last, “we’d bet­ter go.”

They pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their wands, and crept across the tow­er room, down the spi­ral stair­case, and in­to the Gryffind­or com­mon room. A few em­bers were still glow­ing in the fire­place, turn­ing all the arm­chairs in­to hunched black shad­ows. They had al­most reached the por­trait hole when a voice spoke from the chair near­est them, “I can’t be­lieve you’re go­ing to do this, Har­ry.”

A lamp flick­ered on. It was Hermione Granger, wear­ing a pink bathrobe and a frown.

“You!” said Ron fu­ri­ous­ly. “Go back to bed!”

“I al­most told your broth­er,” Hermione snapped, “Per­cy — he’s a pre­fect, he’d put a stop to this.”

Har­ry couldn’t be­lieve any­one could be so in­ter­fer­ing.

“Come on,” he said to Ron. He pushed open the por­trait of the Fat La­dy and climbed through the hole.

Hermione wasn’t go­ing to give up that eas­ily. She fol­lowed Ron through the por­trait hole, hiss­ing at them like an an­gry goose.

“Don’t you care about Gryffind­or, do you on­ly care about your­selves, I don’t want Slytherin to win the house cup, and you’ll lose all the points I got from Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall for know­ing about Switch­ing Spells.”

“Go away.”

“All right, but I warned you, you just re­mem­ber what I said when you’re on the train home to­mor­row, you’re so —”

But what they were, they didn’t find out. Hermione had turned to the por­trait of the Fat La­dy to get back in­side and found her­self fac­ing an emp­ty paint­ing. The Fat La­dy had gone on a night­time vis­it and Hermione was locked out of Gryffind­or tow­er.

“Now what am I go­ing to do?” she asked shril­ly.

“That’s your prob­lem,” said Ron. “We’ve got to go, we’re go­ing to be late.”

They hadn’t even reached the end of the cor­ri­dor when Hermione caught up with them.

“I’m com­ing with you,” she said.

“You are not.”

“D’you think I’m go­ing to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch me? If he finds all three of us I’ll tell him the truth, that I was try­ing to stop you, and you can back me up.”

“You’ve got some nerve —” said Ron loud­ly.

“Shut up, both of you!” said Har­ry sharply. I heard some­thing.”

It was a sort of snuf­fling.

“Mrs. Nor­ris?” breathed Ron, squint­ing through the dark.

It wasn’t Mrs. Nor­ris. It was Neville. He was curled up on the floor, fast asleep, but jerked sud­den­ly awake as they crept near­er.

“Thank good­ness you found me! I’ve been out here for hours, I couldn’t re­mem­ber the new pass­word to get in to bed.”

“Keep your voice down, Neville. The pass­word’s ‘Pig snout’ but it won’t help you now, the Fat La­dy’s gone off some­where.”

“How’s your arm?” said Har­ry.

“Fine,” said Neville, show­ing them. “Madam Pom­frey mend­ed it in about a minute.”

“Good — well, look, Neville, we’ve got to be some­where, we’ll see you lat­er —”

“Don’t leave me!” said Neville, scram­bling to his feet, “I don’t want to stay here alone, the Bloody Baron’s been past twice al­ready.”

Ron looked at his watch and then glared fu­ri­ous­ly at Hermione and Neville.

“If ei­ther of you get us caught, I’ll nev­er rest un­til I’ve learned that Curse of the Bo­gies Quir­rell told us about, and used it on you.”

Hermione opened her mouth, per­haps to tell Ron ex­act­ly how to use the Curse of the Bo­gies, but Har­ry hissed at her to be qui­et and beck­oned them all for­ward.

They flit­ted along cor­ri­dors striped with bars of moon­light from the high win­dows. At ev­ery turn Har­ry ex­pect­ed to run in­to Filch or Mrs. Nor­ris, but they were lucky. They sped up a stair­case to the third floor and tip­toed to­ward the tro­phy room.

Mal­foy and Crabbe weren’t there yet. The crys­tal tro­phy cas­es glim­mered where the moon­light caught them. Cups, shields, plates, and stat­ues winked sil­ver and gold in the dark­ness. They edged along the walls, keep­ing their eyes on the doors at ei­ther end of the room. Har­ry took out his wand in case Mal­foy leapt in and start­ed at once. The min­utes crept by.

“He’s late, maybe he’s chick­ened out,” Ron whis­pered.

Then a noise in the next room made them jump. Har­ry had on­ly just raised his wand when they heard some­one speak — and it wasn’t Mal­foy.

“Sniff around, my sweet, they might be lurk­ing in a cor­ner.”

It was Filch speak­ing to Mrs. Nor­ris. Hor­ror-​struck, Har­ry waved mad­ly at the oth­er three to fol­low him as quick­ly as pos­si­ble; they scur­ried silent­ly to­ward the door, away from Filch’s voice. Neville’s robes had bare­ly whipped round the cor­ner when they heard Filch en­ter the tro­phy room.

“They’re in here some­where,” they heard him mut­ter, “prob­ably hid­ing.”

“This way!” Har­ry mouthed to the oth­ers and, pet­ri­fied, they be­gan to creep down a long gallery full of suits of ar­mor. They could hear Filch get­ting near­er. Neville sud­den­ly let out a fright­ened squeak and broke in­to a run he tripped, grabbed Ron around the waist, and the pair of them top­pled right in­to a suit of ar­mor.

The clang­ing and crash­ing were enough to wake the whole cas­tle.

“RUN!” Har­ry yelled, and the four of them sprint­ed down the gallery, not look­ing back to see whether Filch was fol­low­ing — they swung around the door­post and gal­loped down one cor­ri­dor then an­oth­er, Har­ry in the lead, with­out any idea where they were or where they were go­ing — they ripped through a tapestry and found them­selves in a hid­den pas­sage­way, hur­tled along it and came out near their Charms class­room, which they knew was miles from the tro­phy room.

“I think we’ve lost him,” Har­ry pant­ed, lean­ing against the cold wall and wip­ing his fore­head. Neville was bent dou­ble, wheez­ing and splut­ter­ing.

I — told — you,” Hermione gasped, clutch­ing at the stitch in her chest, “I — told — you.”

“We’ve got to get back to Gryffind­or tow­er,” said Ron, “quick­ly as pos­si­ble.”

“Mal­foy tricked you,” Hermione said to Har­ry. “You re­al­ize that, don’t you? He was nev­er go­ing to meet you — Filch knew some­one was go­ing to be in the tro­phy room, Mal­foy must have tipped him off.”

Har­ry thought she was prob­ably right, but he wasn’t go­ing to tell her that.

“Let’s go.”

It wasn’t go­ing to be that sim­ple. They hadn’t gone more than a dozen paces when a door­knob rat­tled and some­thing came shoot­ing out of a class­room in front of them.

It was Peeves. He caught sight of them and gave a squeal of de­light.

“Shut up, Peeves — please — you’ll get us thrown out.”

Peeves cack­led.

“Wan­der­ing around at mid­night, Ick­le Firsties? Tut, tut, tut. Naughty, naughty, you’ll get caughty.”

“Not if you don’t give us away, Peeves, please.”

“Should tell Filch, I should,” said Peeves in a saint­ly voice, but his eyes glit­tered wicked­ly. “It’s for your own good, you know.”

“Get out of the way,” snapped Ron, tak­ing a swipe at Peeves this was a big mis­take.

“STU­DENTS OUT OF BED!” Peeves bel­lowed, “STU­DENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS COR­RI­DOR!”

Duck­ing un­der Peeves, they ran for their lives, right to the end of the cor­ri­dor where they slammed in­to a door — and it was locked.

“This is it!” Ron moaned, as they pushed help­less­ly at the door, “We’re done for! This is the end!”

They could hear foot­steps, Filch run­ning as fast as he could to­ward Peeves’s shouts.

“Oh, move over,” Hermione snarled. She grabbed Har­ry’s wand, tapped the lock, and whis­pered, “Alo­homo­ra!”

The lock clicked and the door swung open — they piled through it, shut it quick­ly, and pressed their ears against it, lis­ten­ing.

“Which way did they go, Peeves?” Filch was say­ing. “Quick, tell me.”

“Say ‘please.’”

“Don’t mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go?”

“Shan’t say noth­ing if you don’t say please,” said Peeves in his an­noy­ing singsong voice.

“All right — please.”

“NOTH­ING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn’t say noth­ing if you didn’t say please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!” And they heard the sound of Peeves whoosh­ing away and Filch curs­ing in rage.

“He thinks this door is locked,” Har­ry whis­pered. “I think we’ll be okay — get off, Neville!” For Neville had been tug­ging on the sleeve of Har­ry’s bathrobe for the last minute. “What?”

Har­ry turned around — and saw, quite clear­ly, what. For a mo­ment, he was sure he’d walked in­to a night­mare — this was too much, on top of ev­ery­thing that had hap­pened so far.

They weren’t in a room, as he had sup­posed. They were in a cor­ri­dor. The for­bid­den cor­ri­dor on the third floor. And now they knew why it was for­bid­den.

They were look­ing straight in­to the eyes of a mon­strous dog, a dog that filled the whole space be­tween ceil­ing and floor. It had three heads. Three pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitch­ing and quiv­er­ing in their di­rec­tion; three drool­ing mouths, sali­va hang­ing in slip­pery ropes from yel­low­ish fangs.

It was stand­ing quite still, all six eyes star­ing at them, and Har­ry knew that the on­ly rea­son they weren’t al­ready dead was that their sud­den ap­pear­ance had tak­en it by sur­prise, but it was quick­ly get­ting over that, there was no mis­tak­ing what those thun­der­ous growls meant.

Har­ry groped for the door­knob — be­tween Filch and death, he’d take Filch.

They fell back­ward — Har­ry slammed the door shut, and they ran, they al­most flew, back down the cor­ri­dor. Filch must have hur­ried off to look for them some­where else, be­cause they didn’t see him any­where, but they hard­ly cared — all they want­ed to do was put as much space as pos­si­ble be­tween them and that mon­ster. They didn’t stop run­ning un­til they reached the por­trait of the Fat La­dy on the sev­enth floor.

“Where on earth have you all been?” she asked, look­ing at their bathrobes hang­ing off their shoul­ders and their flushed, sweaty faces.

“Nev­er mind that — pig snout, pig snout,” pant­ed Har­ry, and the por­trait swung for­ward. They scram­bled in­to the com­mon room and col­lapsed, trem­bling, in­to arm­chairs.

It was a while be­fore any of them said any­thing. Neville, in­deed, looked as if he’d nev­er speak again.

“What do they think they’re do­ing, keep­ing a thing like that locked up in a school?” said Ron fi­nal­ly. “If any dog needs ex­er­cise, that one does.”

Hermione had got both her breath and her bad tem­per back again. “You don’t use your eyes, any of you, do you?” she snapped. “Didn’t you see what it was stand­ing on.

“The floor?” Har­ry sug­gest­ed. “I wasn’t look­ing at its feet, I was too busy with its heads.”

“No, not the floor. It was stand­ing on a trap­door. It’s ob­vi­ous­ly guard­ing some­thing.”

She stood up, glar­ing at them.

“I hope you’re pleased with your­selves. We could all have been killed — or worse, ex­pelled. Now, if you don’t mind, I’m go­ing to bed.”

Ron stared af­ter her, his mouth open.

“No, we don’t mind,” he said. “You’d think we dragged her along, wouldn’t you.

But Hermione had giv­en Har­ry some­thing else to think about as he climbed back in­to bed. The dog was guard­ing some­thing…What had Ha­grid said? Gringotts was the safest place in the world for some­thing you want­ed to hide — ex­cept per­haps Hog­warts.

It looked as though Har­ry had found out where the grub­by lit­tle pack­age from vault sev­en hun­dred and thir­teen was.





HP 1 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone





CHAPTER TEN




HAL­LOWEEN



M al­foy couldn’t be­lieve his eyes when he saw that Har­ry and Ron were still at Hog­warts the next day, look­ing tired but per­fect­ly cheer­ful. In­deed, by the next morn­ing Har­ry and Ron thought that meet­ing the three-​head­ed dog had been an ex­cel­lent ad­ven­ture, and they were quite keen to have an­oth­er one. In the mean­time, Har­ry filled Ron in about the pack­age that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hog­warts, and they spent a lot of time won­der­ing what could pos­si­bly need such heavy pro­tec­tion.

“It’s ei­ther re­al­ly valu­able or re­al­ly dan­ger­ous,” said Ron.

“Or both,” said Har­ry.

But as all they knew for sure about the mys­te­ri­ous ob­ject was that it was about two inch­es long, they didn’t have much chance of guess­ing what it was with­out fur­ther clues.

Nei­ther Neville nor Hermione showed the slight­est in­ter­est in what lay un­der­neath the dog and the trap­door. All Neville cared about was nev­er go­ing near the dog again.

Hermione was now re­fus­ing to speak to Har­ry and Ron, but she was such a bossy know-​it-​all that they saw this as an added bonus. All they re­al­ly want­ed now was a way of get­ting back at Mal­foy, and to their great de­light, just such a thing ar­rived in the mail about a week lat­er.

As the owls flood­ed in­to the Great Hall as usu­al, ev­ery­one’s at­ten­tion was caught at once by a long, thin pack­age car­ried by six large screech owls. Har­ry was just as in­ter­est­ed as ev­ery­one else to see what was in this large par­cel, and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him, knock­ing his ba­con to the floor. They had hard­ly flut­tered out of the way when an­oth­er owl dropped a let­ter on top of the par­cel.

Har­ry ripped open the let­ter first, which was lucky, be­cause it said:



DO NOT OPEN THE PAR­CEL AT THE TA­BLE.

It con­tains your new Nim­bus Two Thou­sand, but I don’t want ev­ery­body know­ing you’ve got a broom­stick or they’ll all want one. Oliv­er Wood will meet you tonight on the Quid­ditch field at sev­en o’clock for your first train­ing ses­sion.



Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall



Har­ry had dif­fi­cul­ty hid­ing his glee as he hand­ed the note to Ron to read.

“A Nim­bus Two Thou­sand!” Ron moaned en­vi­ous­ly. “I’ve nev­er even touched one.”

They left the hall quick­ly, want­ing to un­wrap the broom­stick in pri­vate be­fore their first class, but halfway across the en­trance hall they found the way up­stairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle. Mal­foy seized the pack­age from Har­ry and felt it.

“That’s a broom­stick,” he said, throw­ing it back to Har­ry with a mix­ture of jeal­ousy and spite on his face. “You’ll be in for it this time, Pot­ter, first years aren’t al­lowed them.”

Ron couldn’t re­sist it.

“It’s not any old broom­stick,” he said, “it’s a Nim­bus Two Thou­sand. What did you say you’ve got at home, Mal­foy, a Comet Two Six­ty?” Ron grinned at Har­ry. “Comets look flashy, but they’re not in the same league as the Nim­bus.”

“What would you know about it, Weasley, you couldn’t af­ford half the han­dle,” Mal­foy snapped back. “I sup­pose you and your broth­ers have to save up twig by twig.”

Be­fore Ron could an­swer, Pro­fes­sor Flitwick ap­peared at Mal­foy’s el­bow.

“Not ar­gu­ing, I hope, boys?” he squeaked.

“Pot­ter’s been sent a broom­stick, Pro­fes­sor,” said Mal­foy quick­ly.

“Yes, yes, that’s right,” said Pro­fes­sor Flitwick, beam­ing at Har­ry. “Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall told me all about the spe­cial cir­cum­stances, Pot­ter. And what mod­el is it?”

“A Nim­bus Two Thou­sand, it is,” said Har­ry, fight­ing not to laugh at the look of hor­ror on Mal­foy’s face. “And it’s re­al­ly thanks to Mal­foy here that I’ve got it,” he added.

Har­ry and Ron head­ed up­stairs, smoth­er­ing their laugh­ter at Mal­foy’s ob­vi­ous rage and con­fu­sion.

“Well, it’s true,” Har­ry chor­tled as they reached the top of the mar­ble stair­case, “If he hadn’t stolen Neville’s Re­mem­brall I wouldn’t be on the team.…”

“So I sup­pose you think that’s a re­ward for break­ing rules?” came an an­gry voice from just be­hind them. Hermione was stomp­ing up the stairs, look­ing dis­ap­prov­ing­ly at the pack­age in Har­ry’s hand.

“I thought you weren’t speak­ing to us?” said Har­ry.

“Yes, don’t stop now,” said Ron, “it’s do­ing us so much good.”

Hermione marched away with her nose in the air.

Har­ry had a lot of trou­ble keep­ing his mind on his lessons that day. It kept wan­der­ing up to the dor­mi­to­ry where his new broom­stick was ly­ing un­der his bed, or stray­ing off to the Quid­ditch field where he’d be learn­ing to play that night. He bolt­ed his din­ner that evening with­out notic­ing what he was eat­ing, and then rushed up­stairs with Ron to un­wrap the Nim­bus Two Thou­sand at last.

“Wow,” Ron sighed, as the broom­stick rolled on­to Har­ry’s bed­spread.

Even Har­ry, who knew noth­ing about the dif­fer­ent brooms, thought it looked won­der­ful. Sleek and shiny, with a ma­hogany han­dle, it had a long tail of neat, straight twigs and Nim­bus Two Thou­sand writ­ten in gold near the top.

As sev­en o’clock drew near­er, Har­ry left the cas­tle and set off in the dusk to­ward the Quid­ditch field. Held nev­er been in­side the sta­di­um be­fore. Hun­dreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spec­ta­tors were high enough to see what was go­ing on. At ei­ther end of the field were three gold­en poles with hoops on the end. They re­mind­ed Har­ry of the lit­tle plas­tic sticks Mug­gle chil­dren blew bub­bles through, ex­cept that they were fifty feet high.

Too ea­ger to fly again to wait for Wood, Har­ry mount­ed his broom­stick and kicked off from the ground. What a feel­ing — he swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field. The Nim­bus Two Thou­sand turned wher­ev­er he want­ed at his light­est touch.

“Hey, Pot­ter, come down!”

Oliv­er Wood had ar­rived. He was car­ry­ing a large wood­en crate un­der his arm. Har­ry land­ed next to him.

“Very nice,” said Wood, his eyes glint­ing. “I see what McG­ona­gall meant…you re­al­ly are a nat­ural. I’m just go­ing to teach you the rules this evening, then you’ll be join­ing team prac­tice three times a week.”

He opened the crate. In­side were four dif­fer­ent-​sized balls.

“Right,” said Wood. “Now, Quid­ditch is easy enough to un­der­stand, even if it’s not too easy to play. There are sev­en play­ers on each side. Three of them are called Chasers.”

“Three Chasers,” Har­ry re­peat­ed, as Wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soc­cer ball.

“This ball’s called the Quaf­fle,” said Wood. “The Chasers throw the Quaf­fle to each oth­er and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal. Ten points ev­ery time the Quaf­fle goes through one of the hoops. Fol­low me?”

“The Chasers throw the Quaf­fle and put it through the hoops to score,” Har­ry re­cit­ed. “So — that’s sort of like bas­ket­ball on broom­sticks with six hoops, isn’t it?”

“What’s bas­ket­ball?” said Wood cu­ri­ous­ly.

“Nev­er mind,” said Har­ry quick­ly.

“Now, there’s an­oth­er play­er on each side who’s called the Keep­er — I’m Keep­er for Gryffind­or. I have to fly around our hoops and stop the oth­er team from scor­ing.”

“Three Chasers, one Keep­er,” said Har­ry, who was de­ter­mined to re­mem­ber it all. “And they play with the Quaf­fle. Okay, got that. So what are they for?” He point­ed at the three balls left in­side the box.

“I’ll show you now,” said Wood. “Take this.”

He hand­ed Har­ry a small club, a bit like a short base­ball bat.

“I’m go­ing to show you what the Bludgers do,” Wood said. “These two are the Bludgers.”

He showed Har­ry two iden­ti­cal balls, jet black and slight­ly small­er than the red Quaf­fle. Har­ry no­ticed that they seemed to be strain­ing to es­cape the straps hold­ing them in­side the box.

“Stand back,” Wood warned Har­ry. He bent down and freed one of the Bludgers.

At once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelt­ed straight at Har­ry’s face. Har­ry swung at it with the bat to stop it from break­ing his nose, and sent it zigzag­ging away in­to the air — it zoomed around their heads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of it and man­aged to pin it to the ground.

“See?” Wood pant­ed, forc­ing the strug­gling Bludger back in­to the crate and strap­ping it down safe­ly. “The Bludgers rock­et around, try­ing to knock play­ers off their brooms. That’s why you have two Beat­ers on each team — the Weasley twins are ours — it’s their job to pro­tect their side from the Bludgers and try and knock them to­ward the oth­er team. So — think you’ve got all that?”

“Three Chasers try and score with the Quaf­fle; the Keep­er guards the goal posts; the Beat­ers keep the Bludgers away from their team,” Har­ry reeled off.

“Very good,” said Wood.

“Er — have the Bludgers ev­er killed any­one?” Har­ry asked, hop­ing he sound­ed off­hand.

“Nev­er at Hog­warts. We’ve had a cou­ple of bro­ken jaws but noth­ing worse than that. Now, the last mem­ber of the team is the Seek­er. That’s you. And you don’t have to wor­ry about the Quaf­fle or the Bludgers —”

“— un­less they crack my head open.”

“Don’t wor­ry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers — I mean, they’re like a pair of hu­man Bludgers them­selves.”

Wood reached in­to the crate and took out the fourth and last ball. Com­pared with the Quaf­fle and the Bludgers, it was tiny, about the size of a large wal­nut. It was bright gold and had lit­tle flut­ter­ing sil­ver wings.

“This,” said Wood, “is the Gold­en Snitch, and it’s the most im­por­tant ball of the lot. It’s very hard to catch be­cause it’s so fast and dif­fi­cult to see. It’s the Seek­er’s job to catch it. You’ve got to weave in and out of the Chasers, Beat­ers, Bludgers, and Quaf­fle to get it be­fore the oth­er team’s Seek­er, be­cause whichev­er Seek­er catch­es the Snitch wins his team an ex­tra hun­dred and fifty points, so they near­ly al­ways win. That’s why Seek­ers get fouled so much. A game of Quid­ditch on­ly ends when the Snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages — I think the record is three months, they had to keep bring­ing on sub­sti­tutes so the play­ers could get some sleep.

“Well, that’s it any ques­tions?”

Har­ry shook his head. He un­der­stood what he had to do all right, it was do­ing it that was go­ing to be the prob­lem.

“We won’t prac­tice with the Snitch yet,” said Wood, care­ful­ly shut­ting it back in­side the crate, “it’s too dark, we might lose it. Let’s try you out with a few of these.”

He pulled a bag of or­di­nary golf balls out of his pock­et and a few min­utes lat­er, he and Har­ry were up in the air, Wood throw­ing the golf balls as hard as he could in ev­ery di­rec­tion for Har­ry to catch.

Har­ry didn’t miss a sin­gle one, and Wood was de­light­ed. Af­ter half an hour, night had re­al­ly fall­en and they couldn’t car­ry on.

“That Quid­ditch Cup’ll have our name on it this year,” said Wood hap­pi­ly as they trudged back up to the cas­tle. “I wouldn’t be sur­prised if you turn out bet­ter than Char­lie Weasley, and he could have played for Eng­land if he hadn’t gone off chas­ing drag­ons.”



Per­haps it was be­cause he was now so busy, what with Quid­ditch prac­tice three evenings a week on top of all his home­work, but Har­ry could hard­ly be­lieve it when he re­al­ized that he’d al­ready been at Hog­warts two months. The cas­tle felt more like home than Priv­et Drive ev­er had. His lessons, too, were be­com­ing more and more in­ter­est­ing now that they had mas­tered the ba­sics.

On Hal­loween morn­ing they woke to the de­li­cious smell of bak­ing pump­kin waft­ing through the cor­ri­dors. Even bet­ter, Pro­fes­sor Flitwick an­nounced in Charms that he thought they were ready to start mak­ing ob­jects fly, some­thing they had all been dy­ing to try since they’d seen him make Neville’s toad zoom around the class­room. Pro­fes­sor Flitwick put the class in­to pairs to prac­tice. Har­ry’s part­ner was Sea­mus Finni­gan (which was a re­lief, be­cause Neville had been try­ing to catch his eye). Ron, how­ev­er, was to be work­ing with Hermione Granger. It was hard to tell whether Ron or Hermione was an­gri­er about this. She hadn’t spo­ken to ei­ther of them since the day Har­ry’s broom­stick had ar­rived.

“Now, don’t for­get that nice wrist move­ment we’ve been prac­tic­ing!” squeaked Pro­fes­sor Flitwick, perched on top of his pile of books as usu­al. “Swish and flick, re­mem­ber, swish and flick. And say­ing the mag­ic words prop­er­ly is very im­por­tant, too — nev­er for­get Wiz­ard Baruf­fio, who said ‘s’ in­stead of ‘f’ and found him­self on the floor with a buf­fa­lo on his chest.”

It was very dif­fi­cult. Har­ry and Sea­mus swished and flicked, but the feath­er they were sup­posed to be send­ing sky­ward just lay on the desk­top. Sea­mus got so im­pa­tient that he prod­ded it with his wand and set fire to it — Har­ry had to put it out with his hat.

Ron, at the next ta­ble, wasn’t hav­ing much more luck.

“Wingardi­um Leviosa!” he shout­ed, wav­ing his long arms like a wind­mill.

“You’re say­ing it wrong,” Har­ry heard Hermione snap. “It’s Wing-​gar-​di­um Levi-​o-​sa, make the ‘gar’ nice and long.”

“You do it, then, if you’re so clever,” Ron snarled.

Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and said, “Wingardi­um Leviosa!”

Their feath­er rose off the desk and hov­ered about four feet above their heads.

“Oh, well done!” cried Pro­fes­sor Flitwick, clap­ping. “Ev­ery­one see here, Miss Granger’s done it!”

Ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class.

“It’s no won­der no one can stand her,” he said to Har­ry as they pushed their way in­to the crowd­ed cor­ri­dor, “she’s a night­mare, hon­est­ly.”

Some­one knocked in­to Har­ry as they hur­ried past him. It was Hermione. Har­ry caught a glimpse of her face — and was star­tled to see that she was in tears.

“I think she heard you.”

“So?” said Ron, but he looked a bit un­com­fort­able. “She must’ve no­ticed she’s got no friends.”

Hermione didn’t turn up for the next class and wasn’t seen all af­ter­noon. On their way down to the Great Hall for the Hal­loween feast, Har­ry and Ron over­heard Par­vati Patil telling her friend Laven­der that Hermione was cry­ing in the girls’ bath­room and want­ed to be left alone. Ron looked still more awk­ward at this, but a mo­ment lat­er they had en­tered the Great Hall, where the Hal­loween dec­ora­tions put Hermione out of their minds.

A thou­sand live bats flut­tered from the walls and ceil­ing while a thou­sand more swooped over the ta­bles in low black clouds, mak­ing the can­dles in the pump­kins stut­ter. The feast ap­peared sud­den­ly on the gold­en plates, as it had at the start-​of-​term ban­quet.

Har­ry was just help­ing him­self to a baked pota­to when Pro­fes­sor Quir­rell came sprint­ing in­to the hall, his tur­ban askew and ter­ror on his face. Ev­ery­one stared as he reached Pro­fes­sor Dum­ble­dore’s chair, slumped against the ta­ble, and gasped, “Troll — in the dun­geons — thought you ought to know.”

He then sank to the floor in a dead faint.

There was an up­roar. It took sev­er­al pur­ple fire­crack­ers ex­plod­ing from the end of Pro­fes­sor Dum­ble­dore’s wand to bring si­lence.

“Pre­fects,” he rum­bled, “lead your Hous­es back to the dor­mi­to­ries im­me­di­ate­ly!”

Per­cy was in his el­ement.

“Fol­low me! Stick to­geth­er, first years! No need to fear the troll if you fol­low my or­ders! Stay close be­hind me, now. Make way, first years com­ing through! Ex­cuse me, I’m a pre­fect!”

“How could a troll get in?” Har­ry asked as they climbed the stairs.

“Don’t ask me, they’re sup­posed to be re­al­ly stupid,” said Ron. “Maybe Peeves let it in for a Hal­loween joke.”

They passed dif­fer­ent groups of peo­ple hur­ry­ing in dif­fer­ent di­rec­tions. As they jos­tled their way through a crowd of con­fused Huf­flepuffs, Har­ry sud­den­ly grabbed Ron’s arm.

“I’ve just thought — Hermione.”

“What about her?”

“She doesn’t know about the troll.”

Ron bit his lip.

“Oh, all right,” he snapped. “But Per­cy’d bet­ter not see us.”

Duck­ing down, they joined the Huf­flepuffs go­ing the oth­er way, slipped down a de­sert­ed side cor­ri­dor, and hur­ried off to­ward the girls’ bath­room. They had just turned the cor­ner when they heard quick foot­steps be­hind them.

“Per­cy!” hissed Ron, pulling Har­ry be­hind a large stone grif­fin.

Peer­ing around it, how­ev­er, they saw not Per­cy but Snape. He crossed the cor­ri­dor and dis­ap­peared from view.

“What’s he do­ing?” Har­ry whis­pered. “Why isn’t he down in the dun­geons with the rest of the teach­ers?”

“Search me.”

Qui­et­ly as pos­si­ble, they crept along the next cor­ri­dor af­ter Snape’s fad­ing foot­steps.

“He’s head­ing for the third floor,” Har­ry said, but Ron held up his hand.

“Can you smell some­thing?”

Har­ry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nos­trils, a mix­ture of old socks and the kind of pub­lic toi­let no one seems to clean.

And then they heard it — a low grunt­ing, and the shuf­fling foot­falls of gi­gan­tic feet. Ron point­ed — at the end of a pas­sage to the left, some­thing huge was mov­ing to­ward them. They shrank in­to the shad­ows and watched as it emerged in­to a patch of moon­light.

It was a hor­ri­ble sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, gran­ite gray, its great lumpy body like a boul­der with its small bald head perched on top like a co­conut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat, horny feet. The smell com­ing from it was in­cred­ible. It was hold­ing a huge wood­en club, which dragged along the floor be­cause its arms were so long.

The troll stopped next to a door­way and peered in­side. It wag­gled its long ears, mak­ing up its tiny mind, then slouched slow­ly in­to the room.

“The keys in the lock,” Har­ry mut­tered. “We could lock it in.”

“Good idea,” said Ron ner­vous­ly.

They edged to­ward the open door, mouths dry, pray­ing the troll wasn’t about to come out of it. With one great leap, Har­ry man­aged to grab the key, slam the door, and lock it.

“Yes!”

Flushed with their vic­to­ry, they start­ed to run back up the pas­sage, but as they reached the cor­ner they heard some­thing that made their hearts stop — a high, pet­ri­fied scream — and it was com­ing from the cham­ber they’d just chained up.

“Oh, no,” said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron.

“It’s the girls’ bath­room!” Har­ry gasped.

“Hermione!” they said to­geth­er.

It was the last thing they want­ed to do, but what choice did they have? Wheel­ing around, they sprint­ed back to the door and turned the key, fum­bling in their pan­ic. Har­ry pulled the door open and they ran in­side.

Hermione Granger was shrink­ing against the wall op­po­site, look­ing as if she was about to faint. The troll was ad­vanc­ing on her, knock­ing the sinks off the walls as it went.

“Con­fuse it!” Har­ry said des­per­ate­ly to Ron, and, seiz­ing a tap, he threw it as hard as he could against the wall.

The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione. It lum­bered around, blink­ing stupid­ly, to see what had made the noise. Its mean lit­tle eyes saw Har­ry. It hes­itat­ed, then made for him in­stead, lift­ing its club as it went.

“Oy, pea-​brain!” yelled Ron from the oth­er side of the cham­ber, and he threw a met­al pipe at it. The troll didn’t even seem to no­tice the pipe hit­ting its shoul­der, but it heard the yell and paused again, turn­ing its ug­ly snout to­ward Ron in­stead, giv­ing Har­ry time to run around it.

“Come on, run, run!” Har­ry yelled at Hermione, try­ing to pull her to­ward the door, but she couldn’t move, she was still flat against the wall, her mouth open with ter­ror.

The shout­ing and the echoes seemed to be driv­ing the troll berserk. It roared again and start­ed to­ward Ron, who was near­est and had no way to es­cape.

Har­ry then did some­thing that was both very brave and very stupid: He took a great run­ning jump and man­aged to fas­ten his arms around the troll’s neck from be­hind. The troll couldn’t feel Har­ry hang­ing there, but even a troll will no­tice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose, and Har­ry’s wand had still been in his hand when he’d jumped – it had gone straight up one of the troll’s nos­trils.

Howl­ing with pain, the troll twist­ed and flailed its club, with Har­ry cling­ing on for dear life; any sec­ond, the troll was go­ing to rip him off or catch him a ter­ri­ble blow with the club.

Hermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled out his own wand — not know­ing what he was go­ing to do he heard him­self cry the first spell that came in­to his head: “Wingardi­um Leviosa!”

The club flew sud­den­ly out of the troll’s hand, rose high, high up in­to the air, turned slow­ly over — and dropped, with a sick­en­ing crack, on­to its own­er’s head. The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face, with a thud that made the whole room trem­ble.

Har­ry got to his feet. He was shak­ing and out of breath. Ron was stand­ing there with his wand still raised, star­ing at what he had done.

It was Hermione who spoke first.

“Is it — dead?”

“I don’t think so,” said Har­ry, I think it’s just been knocked out.”

He bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll’s nose. It was cov­ered in what looked like lumpy gray glue.

“Urgh — troll boogers.”

He wiped it on the troll’s trousers.

A sud­den slam­ming and loud foot­steps made the three of them look up. They hadn’t re­al­ized what a rack­et they had been mak­ing, but of course, some­one down­stairs must have heard the crash­es and the troll’s roars. A mo­ment lat­er, Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall had come burst­ing in­to the room, close­ly fol­lowed by Snape, with Quir­rell bring­ing up the rear. Quir­rell took one look at the troll, let out a faint whim­per, and sat quick­ly down on a toi­let, clutch­ing his heart.

Snape bent over the troll. Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall was look­ing at Ron and Har­ry. Har­ry had nev­er seen her look so an­gry. Her lips were white. Hopes of win­ning fifty points for Gryffind­or fad­ed quick­ly from Har­ry’s mind.

“What on earth were you think­ing of?” said Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall, with cold fury in her voice. Har­ry looked at Ron, who was still stand­ing with his wand in the air. “You’re lucky you weren’t killed. Why aren’t you in your dor­mi­to­ry?”

Snape gave Har­ry a swift, pierc­ing look. Har­ry looked at the floor. He wished Ron would put his wand down.

Then a small voice came out of the shad­ows.

“Please, Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall — they were look­ing for me.”

“Miss Granger!”

Hermione had man­aged to get to her feet at last.

“I went look­ing for the troll be­cause I — I thought I could deal with it on my own — you know, be­cause I’ve read all about them.”

Ron dropped his wand. Hermione Granger, telling a down­right lie to a teach­er?

“If they hadn’t found me, I’d be dead now. Har­ry stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club. They didn’t have time to come and fetch any­one. It was about to fin­ish me off when they ar­rived.”

Har­ry and Ron tried to look as though this sto­ry wasn’t new to them.

“Well — in that case ...” said Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall, star­ing at the three of them, “Miss Granger, you fool­ish girl, how could you think of tack­ling a moun­tain troll on your own?”

Hermione hung her head. Har­ry was speech­less. Hermione was the last per­son to do any­thing against the rules, and here she was, pre­tend­ing she had, to get them out of trou­ble. It was as if Snape had start­ed hand­ing out sweets.

“Miss Granger, five points will be tak­en from Gryffind­or for this,” said Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall. “I’m very dis­ap­point­ed in you. If you’re not hurt at all, you’d bet­ter get off to Gryffind­or tow­er. Stu­dents are fin­ish­ing the feast in their hous­es.”

Hermione left.

Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall turned to Har­ry and Ron.

“Well, I still say you were lucky, but not many first years could have tak­en on a full-​grown moun­tain troll. You each win Gryffind­or five points. Pro­fes­sor Dum­ble­dore will be in­formed of this. You may go.”

They hur­ried out of the cham­ber and didn’t speak at all un­til they had climbed two floors up. It was a re­lief to be away from the smell of the troll, quite apart from any­thing else.

“We should have got­ten more than ten points,” Ron grum­bled.

“Five, you mean, once she’s tak­en off Hermione’s.”

“Good of her to get us out of trou­ble like that,” Ron ad­mit­ted. “Mind you, we did save her.”

“She might not have need­ed sav­ing if we hadn’t locked the thing in with her,” Har­ry re­mind­ed him.

They had reached the por­trait of the Fat La­dy.

“Pig snout,” they said and en­tered.

The com­mon room was packed and noisy. Ev­ery­one was eat­ing the food that had been sent up. Hermione, how­ev­er, stood alone by the door, wait­ing for them. There was a very em­bar­rassed pause. Then, none of them look­ing at each oth­er, they all said “Thanks,” and hur­ried off to get plates.

But from that mo­ment on, Hermione Granger be­came their friend. There are some things you can’t share with­out end­ing up lik­ing each oth­er, and knock­ing out a twelve-​foot moun­tain troll is one of them.





HP 1 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone





CHAPTER ELEVEN




QUID­DITCH



A s they en­tered Novem­ber, the weath­er turned very cold. The moun­tains around the school be­came icy gray and the lake like chilled steel. Ev­ery morn­ing the ground was cov­ered in frost. Ha­grid could be seen from the up­stairs win­dows de­frost­ing broom­sticks on the Quid­ditch field, bun­dled up in a long mole­skin over­coat, rab­bit fur gloves, and enor­mous beaver­skin boots.

The Quid­ditch sea­son had be­gun. On Sat­ur­day, Har­ry would be play­ing in his first match af­ter weeks of train­ing: Gryffind­or ver­sus Slytherin. If Gryffind­or won, they would move up in­to sec­ond place in the house cham­pi­onship.

Hard­ly any­one had seen Har­ry play be­cause Wood had de­cid­ed that, as their se­cret weapon, Har­ry should be kept, well, se­cret. But the news that he was play­ing Seek­er had leaked out some­how, and Har­ry didn’t know which was worse — peo­ple telling him he’d be bril­liant or peo­ple telling him they’d be run­ning around un­der­neath him hold­ing a mat­tress.

It was re­al­ly lucky that Har­ry now had Hermione as a friend. He didn’t know how he’d have got­ten through all his home­work with­out her, what with all the last-​minute Quid­ditch prac­tice Wood was mak­ing them do. She had al­so lent him Quid­ditch Through the Ages, which turned out to be a very in­ter­est­ing read.

Har­ry learned that there were sev­en hun­dred ways of com­mit­ting a Quid­ditch foul and that all of them had hap­pened dur­ing a World Cup match in 1473; that Seek­ers were usu­al­ly the small­est and fastest play­ers, and that most se­ri­ous Quid­ditch ac­ci­dents seemed to hap­pen to them; that al­though peo­ple rarely died play­ing Quid­ditch, ref­er­ees had been known to van­ish and turn up months lat­er in the Sa­hara Desert.

Hermione had be­come a bit more re­laxed about break­ing rules since Har­ry and Ron had saved her from the moun­tain troll, and she was much nicer for it. The day be­fore Har­ry’s first Quid­ditch match the three of them were out in the freez­ing court­yard dur­ing break, and she had con­jured them up a bright blue fire that could be car­ried around in a jam jar. They were stand­ing with their backs to it, get­ting warm, when Snape crossed the yard. Har­ry no­ticed at once that Snape was limp­ing. Har­ry, Ron, and Hermione moved clos­er to­geth­er to block the fire from view; they were sure it wouldn’t be al­lowed. Un­for­tu­nate­ly, some­thing about their guilty faces caught Snape’s eye. He limped over. He hadn’t seen the fire, but he seemed to be look­ing for a rea­son to tell them off any­way.

“What’s that you’ve got there, Pot­ter?”

It was Quid­ditch Through the Ages. Har­ry showed him.

“Li­brary books are not to be tak­en out­side the school,” said Snape. “Give it to me. Five points from Gryffind­or.”

“He’s just made that rule up,” Har­ry mut­tered an­gri­ly as Snape limped away. “Won­der what’s wrong with his leg?”

“Dun­no, but I hope it’s re­al­ly hurt­ing him,” said Ron bit­ter­ly.



The Gryffind­or com­mon room was very noisy that evening. Har­ry, Ron, and Hermione sat to­geth­er next to a win­dow. Hermione was check­ing Har­ry and Ron’s Charms home­work for them. She would nev­er let them copy (“How will you learn?”), but by ask­ing her to read it through, they got the right an­swers any­way.

Har­ry felt rest­less. He want­ed Quid­ditch Through the Ages back, to take his mind off his nerves about to­mor­row. Why should he be afraid of Snape? Get­ting up, he told Ron and Hermione he was go­ing to ask Snape if he could have it.

“Bet­ter you than me,” they said to­geth­er, but Har­ry had an idea that Snape wouldn’t refuse if there were oth­er teach­ers lis­ten­ing.

He made his way down to the staffroom and knocked. There was no an­swer. He knocked again. Noth­ing.

Per­haps Snape had left the book in there? It was worth a try. He pushed the door ajar and peered in­side – and a hor­ri­ble scene met his eyes.

Snape and Filch were in­side, alone. Snape was hold­ing his robes above his knees. One of his legs was bloody and man­gled. Filch was hand­ing Snape ban­dages.

“Blast­ed thing,” Snape was say­ing. “How are you sup­posed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once?”

Har­ry tried to shut the door qui­et­ly, but —

“POT­TER!”

Snape’s face was twist­ed with fury as he dropped his robes quick­ly to hide his leg. Har­ry gulped.

“I just won­dered if I could have my book back.”

“GET OUT! OUT!”

Har­ry left, be­fore Snape could take any more points from Gryffind­or. He sprint­ed back up­stairs.

“Did you get it?” Ron asked as Har­ry joined them. “What’s the mat­ter?”

In a low whis­per, Har­ry told them what he’d seen.

“You know what this means?” he fin­ished breath­less­ly. “He tried to get past that three-​head­ed dog at Hal­loween! That’s where he was go­ing when we saw him — he’s af­ter what­ev­er it’s guard­ing! And I’d bet my broom­stick he let that troll in, to make a di­ver­sion!”

Hermione’s eyes were wide.

“No — he wouldn’t, she said. “I know he’s not very nice, but he wouldn’t try and steal some­thing Dum­ble­dore was keep­ing safe.”

“Hon­est­ly, Hermione, you think all teach­ers are saints or some­thing,” snapped Ron. “I’m with Har­ry. I wouldn’t put any­thing past Snape. But what’s he af­ter? What’s that dog guard­ing?”

Har­ry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same ques­tion. Neville was snor­ing loud­ly, but Har­ry couldn’t sleep. He tried to emp­ty his mind — he need­ed to sleep, he had to, he had his first Quid­ditch match in a few hours – but the ex­pres­sion on Snape’s face when Har­ry had seen his leg wasn’t easy to for­get.



The next morn­ing dawned very bright and cold. The Great Hall was full of the de­li­cious smell of fried sausages and the cheer­ful chat­ter of ev­ery­one look­ing for­ward to a good Quid­ditch match.

“You’ve got to eat some break­fast.”

“I don’t want any­thing.”

“Just a bit of toast,” whee­dled Hermione.

“I’m not hun­gry.”

Har­ry felt ter­ri­ble. In an hour’s time he’d be walk­ing on­to the field.

“Har­ry, you need your strength,” said Sea­mus Finni­gan. “Seek­ers are al­ways the ones who get clob­bered by the oth­er team.”

“Thanks, Sea­mus,” said Har­ry, watch­ing Sea­mus pile ketchup on his sausages.



By eleven o’clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around the Quid­ditch pitch. Many stu­dents had binoc­ulars. The seats might be raised high in the air, but it was still dif­fi­cult to see what was go­ing on some­times.

Ron and Hermione joined Neville, Sea­mus, and Dean the West Ham fan up in the top row. As a sur­prise for Har­ry, they had paint­ed a large ban­ner on one of the sheets Scab­bers had ru­ined. It said Pot­ter for Pres­ident, and Dean, who was good at draw­ing, had done a large Gryffind­or li­on un­der­neath. Then Hermione had per­formed a tricky lit­tle charm so that the paint flashed dif­fer­ent col­ors.

Mean­while, in the lock­er room, Har­ry and the rest of the team were chang­ing in­to their scar­let Quid­ditch robes (Slytherin would be play­ing in green).

Wood cleared his throat for si­lence.

“Okay, men,” he said.

“And wom­en,” said Chas­er An­geli­na John­son.

“And wom­en,” Wood agreed. “This is it.”

“The big one,” said Fred Weasley.

“The one we’ve all been wait­ing for,” said George.

“We know Oliv­er’s speech by heart,” Fred told Har­ry, “we were on the team last year.”

“Shut up, you two,” said Wood. “This is the best team Gryffind­or’s had in years. We’re go­ing to win. I know it.”

He glared at them all as if to say, “Or else.”

“Right. It’s time. Good luck, all of you.”

Har­ry fol­lowed Fred and George out of the lock­er room and, hop­ing his knees weren’t go­ing to give way, walked on­to the field to loud cheers.

Madam Hooch was ref­er­ee­ing. She stood in the mid­dle of the field wait­ing for the two teams, her broom in her hand.

“Now, I want a nice fair game, all of you,” she said, once they were all gath­ered around her. Har­ry no­ticed that she seemed to be speak­ing par­tic­ular­ly to the Slytherin Cap­tain, Mar­cus Flint, a sixth year. Har­ry thought Flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him. Out of the cor­ner of his eye he saw the flut­ter­ing ban­ner high above, flash­ing Pot­ter for Pres­ident over the crowd. His heart skipped. He felt braver.

“Mount your brooms, please.”

Har­ry clam­bered on­to his Nim­bus Two Thou­sand.

Madam Hooch gave a loud blast on her sil­ver whis­tle.

Fif­teen brooms rose up, high, high in­to the air. They were off.

“And the Quaf­fle is tak­en im­me­di­ate­ly by An­geli­na John­son of Gryffind­or — what an ex­cel­lent Chas­er that girl is, and rather at­trac­tive, too —”

“JOR­DAN!”

“Sor­ry, Pro­fes­sor.”

The Weasley twins’ friend, Lee Jor­dan, was do­ing the com­men­tary for the match, close­ly watched by Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall.

“And she’s re­al­ly belt­ing along up there, a neat pass to Ali­cia Spin­net, a good find of Oliv­er Wood’s, last year on­ly a re­serve — back to John­son and — no, the Slytherins have tak­en the Quaf­fle, Slytherin Cap­tain Mar­cus Flint gains the Quaf­fle and off he goes — Flint fly­ing like an ea­gle up there — he’s go­ing to sc— no, stopped by an ex­cel­lent move by Gryffind­or Keep­er Wood and the Gryffind­ors take the Quaf­fle — that’s Chas­er Katie Bell of Gryffind­or there, nice dive around Flint, off up the field and — OUCH — that must have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a Bludger — Quaf­fle tak­en by the Slytherins — that’s Adri­an Pucey speed­ing off to­ward the goal posts, but he’s blocked by a sec­ond Bludger — sent his way by Fred or George Weasley, can’t tell which — nice play by the Gryffind­or Beat­er, any­way, and John­son back in pos­ses­sion of the Quaf­fle, a clear field ahead and off she goes — she’s re­al­ly fly­ing — dodges a speed­ing Bludger — the goal posts are ahead — come on, now, An­geli­na — Keep­er Bletch­ley dives — miss­es — GRYFFIND­ORS SCORE!”

Gryffind­or cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans from the Slytherins.

“Budge up there, move along.”

“Ha­grid!”

Ron and Hermione squeezed to­geth­er to give Ha­grid enough space to join them.

“Bin watchin’ from me hut,” said Ha­grid, pat­ting a large pair of binoc­ulars around his neck, “But it isn’t the same as bein’ in the crowd. No sign of the Snitch yet, eh?”

“Nope,” said Ron. “Har­ry hasn’t had much to do yet.”

“Kept out­ta trou­ble, though, that’s some­thin’,” said Ha­grid, rais­ing his binoc­ulars and peer­ing sky­ward at the speck that was Har­ry.

Way up above them, Har­ry was glid­ing over the game, squint­ing about for some sign of the Snitch. This was part of his and Wood’s game plan.

“Keep out of the way un­til you catch sight of the Snitch,” Wood had said. “We don’t want you at­tacked be­fore you have to be.”

When An­geli­na had scored, Har­ry had done a cou­ple of loop-​the-​loops to let off his feel­ings. Now he was back to star­ing around for the Snitch. Once he caught sight of a flash of gold, but it was just a re­flec­tion from one of the Weasleys’ wrist­watch­es, and once a Bludger de­cid­ed to come pelt­ing his way, more like a can­non­ball than any­thing, but Har­ry dodged it and Fred Weasley came chas­ing af­ter it.

“All right there, Har­ry?” he had time to yell, as he beat the Bludger fu­ri­ous­ly to­ward Mar­cus Flint.

“Slytherin in pos­ses­sion,” Lee Jor­dan was say­ing, “Chas­er Pucey ducks two Bludgers, two Weasleys, and Chas­er Bell, and speeds to­ward the — wait a mo­ment — was that the Snitch?”

A mur­mur ran through the crowd as Adri­an Pucey dropped the Quaf­fle, too busy look­ing over his shoul­der at the flash of gold that had passed his left ear.

Har­ry saw it. In a great rush of ex­cite­ment he dived down­ward af­ter the streak of gold. Slytherin Seek­er Ter­ence Hig­gs had seen it, too. Neck and neck they hur­tled to­ward the Snitch — all the Chasers seemed to have for­got­ten what they were sup­posed to be do­ing as they hung in midair to watch.

Har­ry was faster than Hig­gs — he could see the lit­tle round ball, wings flut­ter­ing, dart­ing up ahead — he put on an ex­tra spurt of speed —

WHAM! A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffind­ors be­low — Mar­cus Flint had blocked Har­ry on pur­pose, and Har­ry’s broom spun off course, Har­ry hold­ing on for dear life.

“Foul!” screamed the Gryffind­ors.

Madam Hooch spoke an­gri­ly to Flint and then or­dered a free shot at the goal posts for Gryffind­or. But in all the con­fu­sion, of course, the Gold­en Snitch had dis­ap­peared from sight again.

Down in the stands, Dean Thomas was yelling, “Send him off, ref! Red card!”

“What are you talk­ing about, Dean?” said Ron.

“Red card!” said Dean fu­ri­ous­ly. “In soc­cer you get shown the red card and you’re out of the game!”

“But this isn’t soc­cer, Dean,” Ron re­mind­ed him.

Ha­grid, how­ev­er, was on Dean’s side.

“They ough­ta change the rules. Flint coul­da knocked Har­ry out­ta the air.”

Lee Jor­dan was find­ing it dif­fi­cult not to take sides.

“So — af­ter that ob­vi­ous and dis­gust­ing bit of cheat­ing —”

“Jor­dan!” growled Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall.

“I mean, af­ter that open and re­volt­ing foul…”

“Jor­dan, I’m warn­ing you —”

“All right, all right. Flint near­ly kills the Gryffind­or Seek­er, which could hap­pen to any­one, I’m sure, so a penal­ty to Gryffind­or, tak­en by Spin­ner, who puts it away, no trou­ble, and we con­tin­ue play, Gryffind­or still in pos­ses­sion.”

It was as Har­ry dodged an­oth­er Bludger, which went spin­ning dan­ger­ous­ly past his head, that it hap­pened. His broom gave a sud­den, fright­en­ing lurch. For a split sec­ond, he thought he was go­ing to fall. He gripped the broom tight­ly with both his hands and knees. He’d nev­er felt any­thing like that.

It hap­pened again. It was as though the broom was try­ing to buck him off. But Nim­bus Two Thou­sands did not sud­den­ly de­cide to buck their rid­ers off. Har­ry tried to turn back to­ward the Gryffind­or goal-​posts — he had half a mind to ask Wood to call time-​out — and then he re­al­ized that his broom was com­plete­ly out of his con­trol. He couldn’t turn it. He couldn’t di­rect it at all. It was zigzag­ging through the air, and ev­ery now and then mak­ing vi­olent swish­ing move­ments that al­most un­seat­ed him.

Lee was still com­men­tat­ing.

“Slytherin in pos­ses­sion — Flint with the Quaf­fle — pass­es Spin­net — pass­es Bell — hit hard in the face by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose — on­ly jok­ing, Pro­fes­sor — Slytherins score — A no…”

The Slytherins were cheer­ing. No one seemed to have no­ticed that Har­ry’s broom was be­hav­ing strange­ly. It was car­ry­ing him slow­ly high­er, away from the game, jerk­ing and twitch­ing as it went.

“Dun­no what Har­ry thinks he’s do­ing,” Ha­grid mum­bled. He stared through his binoc­ulars. “If I didn’ know bet­ter, I’d say he’d lost con­trol of his broom…but he can’t have.…”

Sud­den­ly, peo­ple were point­ing up at Har­ry all over the stands. His broom had start­ed to roll over and over, with him on­ly just man­ag­ing to hold on. Then the whole crowd gasped. Har­ry’s broom had giv­en a wild jerk and Har­ry swung off it. He was now dan­gling from it, hold­ing on with on­ly one hand.

“Did some­thing hap­pen to it when Flint blocked him?” Sea­mus whis­pered.

“Can’t have,” Ha­grid said, his voice shak­ing. “Can’t noth­ing in­ter­fere with a broom­stick ex­cept pow­er­ful Dark mag­ic — no kid could do that to a Nim­bus Two Thou­sand.”

At these words, Hermione seized Ha­grid’s binoc­ulars, but in­stead of look­ing up at Har­ry, she start­ed look­ing fran­ti­cal­ly at the crowd.

“What are you do­ing?” moaned Ron, gray-​faced.

“I knew it,” Hermione gasped, “Snape — look.”

Ron grabbed the binoc­ulars. Snape was in the mid­dle of the stands op­po­site them. He had his eyes fixed on Har­ry and was mut­ter­ing non­stop un­der his breath.

“He’s do­ing some­thing — jinx­ing the broom,” said Hermione.

“What should we do?”

“Leave it to me.”

Be­fore Ron could say an­oth­er word, Hermione had dis­ap­peared. Ron turned the binoc­ulars back on Har­ry. His broom was vi­brat­ing so hard, it was al­most im­pos­si­ble for him to hang on much longer. The whole crowd was on its feet, watch­ing, ter­ri­fied, as the Weasleys flew up to try and pull Har­ry safe­ly on­to one of their brooms, but it was no good – ev­ery time they got near him, the broom would jump high­er still. They dropped low­er and cir­cled be­neath him, ob­vi­ous­ly hop­ing to catch him if he fell. Mar­cus Flint seized the Quaf­fle and scored five times with­out any­one notic­ing.

“Come on, Hermione,” Ron mut­tered des­per­ate­ly.

Hermione had fought her way across to the stand where Snape stood, and was now rac­ing along the row be­hind him; she didn’t even stop to say sor­ry as she knocked Pro­fes­sor Quir­rell head­first in­to the row in front. Reach­ing Snape, she crouched down, pulled out her wand, and whis­pered a few, well-​cho­sen words. Bright blue flames shot from her wand on­to the hem of Snape’s robes.

It took per­haps thir­ty sec­onds for Snape to re­al­ize that he was on fire. A sud­den yelp told her she had done her job. Scoop­ing the fire off him in­to a lit­tle jar in her pock­et, she scram­bled back along the row — Snape would nev­er know what had hap­pened.

It was enough. Up in the air, Har­ry was sud­den­ly able to clam­ber back on to his broom.

“Neville, you can look!” Ron said. Neville had been sob­bing in­to Ha­grid’s jack­et for the last five min­utes.

Har­ry was speed­ing to­ward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick — he hit the field on all fours — coughed — and some­thing gold fell in­to his hand.

“I’ve got the Snitch!” he shout­ed, wav­ing it above his head, and the game end­ed in com­plete con­fu­sion.

“He didn’t catch it, he near­ly swal­lowed it,” Flint was still howl­ing twen­ty min­utes lat­er, but it made no dif­fer­ence — Har­ry hadn’t bro­ken any rules and Lee Jor­dan was still hap­pi­ly shout­ing the re­sults — Gryffind­or had won by one hun­dred and sev­en­ty points to six­ty. Har­ry heard none of this, though. He was be­ing made a cup of strong tea back in Ha­grid’s hut, with Ron and Hermione.

“It was Snape,” Ron was ex­plain­ing, “Hermione and I saw him. He was curs­ing your broom­stick, mut­ter­ing, he wouldn’t take his eyes off you.”

“Rub­bish,” said Ha­grid, who hadn’t heard a word of what had gone on next to him in the stands. “Why would Snape do some­thin’ like that?”

Har­ry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one an­oth­er, won­der­ing what to tell him. Har­ry de­cid­ed on the truth.

“I found out some­thing about him,” he told Ha­grid. “He tried to get past that three-​head­ed dog on Hal­loween. It bit him. We think he was try­ing to steal what­ev­er it’s guard­ing.”

Ha­grid dropped the teapot.

“How do you know about Fluffy?” he said.

“Fluffy?”

“Yeah — he’s mine — bought him off a Greek chap­pie I met in the pub las’ year — I lent him to Dum­ble­dore to guard the —”

“Yes?” said Har­ry ea­ger­ly.

“Now, don’t ask me any­more,” said Ha­grid gruffly. “That’s top se­cret, that is.”

“But Snape’s try­ing to steal it.”

“Rub­bish,” said Ha­grid again. “Snape’s a Hog­warts teach­er, he’d do noth­in’ of the sort.”

“So why did he just try and kill Har­ry?” cried Hermione.

The af­ter­noon’s events cer­tain­ly seemed to have changed her mind about Snape.

“I know a jinx when I see one, Ha­grid, I’ve read all about them! You’ve got to keep eye con­tact, and Snape wasn’t blink­ing at all, I saw him!”

“I’m tellin’ yeh, yer wrong!” said Ha­grid hot­ly. “I don’ know why Har­ry’s broom act­ed like that, but Snape wouldn’ try an’ kill a stu­dent! Now, lis­ten to me, all three of yeh — yer med­dlin’ in things that don’ con­cern yeh. It’s dan­ger­ous. You for­get that dog, an’ you for­get what it’s guardin’, that’s be­tween Pro­fes­sor Dum­ble­dore an’ Nico­las Flamel —”

“Aha!” said Har­ry, “so there’s some­one called Nico­las Flamel in­volved, is there?”

Ha­grid looked fu­ri­ous with him­self.

CHAPTER TWELVE




THE MIR­ROR OF ERISED



C hrist­mas was com­ing. One morn­ing in mid-​De­cem­ber, Hog­warts woke to find it­self cov­ered in sev­er­al feet of snow. The lake froze sol­id and the Weasley twins were pun­ished for be­witch­ing sev­er­al snow­balls so that they fol­lowed Quir­rell around, bounc­ing off the back of his tur­ban. The few owls that man­aged to bat­tle their way through the stormy sky to de­liv­er mail had to be nursed back to health by Ha­grid be­fore they could fly off again.

No one could wait for the hol­idays to start. While the Gryffind­or com­mon room and the Great Hall had roar­ing fires, the drafty cor­ri­dors had be­come icy and a bit­ter wind rat­tled the win­dows in the class­rooms. Worst of all were Pro­fes­sor Snape’s class­es down in the dun­geons, where their breath rose in a mist be­fore them and they kept as close as pos­si­ble to their hot caul­drons.

“I do feel so sor­ry,” said Dra­co Mal­foy, one Po­tions class, “for all those peo­ple who have to stay at Hog­warts for Christ­mas be­cause they’re not want­ed at home.”

He was look­ing over at Har­ry as he spoke. Crabbe and Goyle chuck­led. Har­ry, who was mea­sur­ing out pow­dered spine of li­on­fish, ig­nored them. Mal­foy had been even more un­pleas­ant than usu­al since the Quid­ditch match. Dis­gust­ed that the Slytherins had lost, he had tried to get ev­ery­one laugh­ing at how a wide-​mouthed tree frog would be re­plac­ing Har­ry as Seek­er next. Then he’d re­al­ized that no­body found this fun­ny, be­cause they were all so im­pressed at the way Har­ry had man­aged to stay on his buck­ing broom­stick. So Mal­foy, jeal­ous and an­gry, had gone back to taunt­ing Har­ry about hav­ing no prop­er fam­ily.

It was true that Har­ry wasn’t go­ing back to Priv­et Drive for Christ­mas. Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall had come around the week be­fore, mak­ing a list of stu­dents who would be stay­ing for the hol­idays, and Har­ry had signed up at once. He didn’t feel sor­ry for him­self at all; this would prob­ably be the best Christ­mas he’d ev­er had. Ron and his broth­ers were stay­ing, too, be­cause Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were go­ing to Ro­ma­nia to vis­it Char­lie.

When they left the dun­geons at the end of Po­tions, they found a large fir tree block­ing the cor­ri­dor ahead. Two enor­mous feet stick­ing out at the bot­tom and a loud puff­ing sound told them that Ha­grid was be­hind it.

“Hi, Ha­grid, want any help?” Ron asked, stick­ing his head through the branch­es.

“Nah, I’m all right, thanks, Ron.”

“Would you mind mov­ing out of the way?” came Mal­foy’s cold drawl from be­hind them. “Are you try­ing to earn some ex­tra mon­ey, Weasley? Hop­ing to be game­keep­er your­self when you leave Hog­warts, I sup­pose — that hut of Ha­grid’s must seem like a palace com­pared to what your fam­ily’s used to.”

Ron dived at Mal­foy just as Snape came up the stairs.

“WEASLEY!”

Ron let go of the front of Mal­foy’s robes.

“He was pro­voked, Pro­fes­sor Snape,” said Ha­grid, stick­ing his huge hairy face out from be­hind the tree. “Mal­foy was in­sultin’ his fam­ily.”

“Be that as it may, fight­ing is against Hog­warts rules, Ha­grid,” said Snape silk­ily. “Five points from Gryffind­or, Weasley, and be grate­ful it isn’t more. Move along, all of you.”

Mal­foy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed rough­ly past the tree, scat­ter­ing nee­dles ev­ery­where and smirk­ing.

“I’ll get him,” said Ron, grind­ing his teeth at Mal­foy’s back, “one of these days, I’ll get him —”

“I hate them both,” said Har­ry, “Mal­foy and Snape.”

“Come on, cheer up, it’s near­ly Christ­mas,” said Ha­grid. “Tell yeh what, come with me an’ see the Great Hall, looks a treat.”

So the three of them fol­lowed Ha­grid and his tree off to the Great Hall, where Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall and Pro­fes­sor Flitwick were busy with the Christ­mas dec­ora­tions.

“Ah, Ha­grid, the last tree — put it in the far cor­ner, would you?”

The hall looked spec­tac­ular. Fes­toons of hol­ly and mistle­toe hung all around the walls, and no less than twelve tow­er­ing Christ­mas trees stood around the room, some sparkling with tiny ici­cles, some glit­ter­ing with hun­dreds of can­dles.

“How many days you got left un­til yer hol­idays?” Ha­grid asked.

“Just one,” said Hermione. “And that re­minds me — Har­ry, Ron, we’ve got half an hour be­fore lunch, we should be in the li­brary.”

“Oh yeah, you’re right,” said Ron, tear­ing his eyes away from Pro­fes­sor Flitwick, who had gold­en bub­bles blos­som­ing out of his wand and was trail­ing them over the branch­es of the new tree.

“The li­brary?” said Ha­grid, fol­low­ing them out of the hall. “Just be­fore the hol­idays? Bit keen, aren’t yeh?”

“Oh, we’re not work­ing,” Har­ry told him bright­ly. “Ev­er since you men­tioned Nico­las Flamel we’ve been try­ing to find out who he is.”

“You what?” Ha­grid looked shocked. “Lis­ten here — I’ve told yeh — drop it. It’s noth­in’ to you what that dog’s guardin’.”

“We just want to know who Nico­las Flamel is, that’s all,” said Hermione.

“Un­less you’d like to tell us and save us the trou­ble?” Har­ry added. “We must’ve been through hun­dreds of books al­ready and we can’t find him any­where — just give us a hint — I know I’ve read his name some­where.”

“I’m sayin’ noth­in’, said Ha­grid flat­ly.

“Just have to find out for our­selves, then,” said Ron, and they left Ha­grid look­ing dis­grun­tled and hur­ried off to the li­brary.

They had in­deed been search­ing books for Flamel’s name ev­er since Ha­grid had let it slip, be­cause how else were they go­ing to find out what Snape was try­ing to steal? The trou­ble was, it was very hard to know where to be­gin, not know­ing what Flamel might have done to get him­self in­to a book. He wasn’t in Great Wiz­ards of the Twen­ti­eth Cen­tu­ry, or No­table Mag­ical Names of Our Time; he was miss­ing, too, from Im­por­tant Mod­ern Mag­ical Dis­cov­er­ies, and A Study of Re­cent De­vel­op­ments in Wiz­ardry. And then, of course, there was the sheer size of the li­brary; tens of thou­sands of books; thou­sands of shelves; hun­dreds of nar­row rows.

Hermione took out a list of sub­jects and ti­tles she had de­cid­ed to search while Ron strode off down a row of books and start­ed pulling them off the shelves at ran­dom. Har­ry wan­dered over to the Re­strict­ed Sec­tion. He had been won­der­ing for a while if Flamel wasn’t some­where in there. Un­for­tu­nate­ly, you need­ed a spe­cial­ly signed note from one of the teach­ers to look in any of the re­strict­ed books, and he knew he’d nev­er get one. These were the books con­tain­ing pow­er­ful Dark Mag­ic nev­er taught at Hog­warts, and on­ly read by old­er stu­dents study­ing ad­vanced De­fense Against the Dark Arts.

“What are you look­ing for, boy?”

“Noth­ing,” said Har­ry.

Madam Pince the li­brar­ian bran­dished a feath­er duster at him.

“You’d bet­ter get out, then. Go on — out!”

Wish­ing he’d been a bit quick­er at think­ing up some sto­ry, Har­ry left the li­brary. He, Ron, and Hermione had al­ready agreed they’d bet­ter not ask Madam Pince where they could find Flamel. They were sure she’d be able to tell them, but they couldn’t risk Snape hear­ing what they were up to.

Har­ry wait­ed out­side in the cor­ri­dor to see if the oth­er two had found any­thing, but he wasn’t very hope­ful. They had been look­ing for two weeks, af­ter A, but as they on­ly had odd mo­ments be­tween lessons it wasn’t sur­pris­ing they’d found noth­ing. What they re­al­ly need­ed was a nice long search with­out Madam Pince breath­ing down their necks.

Five min­utes lat­er, Ron and Hermione joined him, shak­ing their heads. They went off to lunch.

“You will keep look­ing while I’m away, won’t you?” said Hermione. “And send me an owl if you find any­thing.”

“And you could ask your par­ents if they know who Flamel is,” said Ron. “It’d be safe to ask them.”

“Very safe, as they’re both den­tists,” said Hermione.



Once the hol­idays had start­ed, Ron and Har­ry were hav­ing too good a time to think much about Flamel. They had the dor­mi­to­ry to them­selves and the com­mon room was far emp­ti­er than usu­al, so they were able to get the good arm­chairs by the fire. They sat by the hour eat­ing any­thing they could spear on a toast­ing fork — bread, En­glish muffins, marsh­mal­lows — and plot­ting ways of get­ting Mal­foy ex­pelled, which were fun to talk about even if they wouldn’t work.

Ron al­so start­ed teach­ing Har­ry wiz­ard chess. This was ex­act­ly like Mug­gle chess ex­cept that the fig­ures were alive, which made it a lot like di­rect­ing troops in bat­tle. Ron’s set was very old and bat­tered. Like ev­ery­thing else he owned, it had once be­longed to some­one else in his fam­ily — in this case, his grand­fa­ther. How­ev­er, old chess­men weren’t a draw­back at all. Ron knew them so well he nev­er had trou­ble get­ting them to do what he want­ed.

Har­ry played with chess­men Sea­mus Finni­gan had lent him, and they didn’t trust him at all. He wasn’t a very good play­er yet and they kept shout­ing dif­fer­ent bits of ad­vice at him, which was con­fus­ing. “Don’t send me there, can’t you see his knight? Send him, we can af­ford to lose him.”

On Christ­mas Eve, Har­ry went to bed look­ing for­ward to the next day for the food and the fun, but not ex­pect­ing any presents at all. When he woke ear­ly in the morn­ing, how­ev­er, the first thing he saw was a small pile of pack­ages at the foot of his bed.

“Mer­ry Christ­mas,” said Ron sleep­ily as Har­ry scram­bled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe.

“You, too,” said Har­ry. “Will you look at this? I’ve got some presents!”

“What did you ex­pect, turnips?” said Ron, turn­ing to his own pile, which was a lot big­ger than Har­ry’s.

Har­ry picked up the top par­cel. It was wrapped in thick brown pa­per and scrawled across it was To Har­ry, from Ha­grid. In­side was a rough­ly cut wood­en flute. Ha­grid had ob­vi­ous­ly whit­tled it him­self. Har­ry blew it — it sound­ed a bit like an owl.

A sec­ond, very small par­cel con­tained a note.

We re­ceived your mes­sage and en­close your Christ­mas present. From Un­cle Ver­non and Aunt Petu­nia. Taped to the note was a fifty-​pence piece.

“That’s friend­ly,” said Har­ry.

Ron was fas­ci­nat­ed by the fifty pence.

“Weird!” he said, ‘What a shape! This is mon­ey?”

“You can keep it,” said Har­ry, laugh­ing at how pleased Ron was. “Ha­grid and my aunt and un­cle — so who sent these?”

“I think I know who that one’s from,” said Ron, turn­ing a bit pink and point­ing to a very lumpy par­cel. “My mom. I told her you didn’t ex­pect any presents and — oh, no,” he groaned, “she’s made you a Weasley sweater.”

Har­ry had torn open the par­cel to find a thick, hand-​knit­ted sweater in emer­ald green and a large box of home­made fudge.

“Ev­ery year she makes us a sweater,” said Ron, un­wrap­ping his own, “and mine’s al­ways ma­roon.”

“That’s re­al­ly nice of her,” said Har­ry, try­ing the fudge, which was very tasty.

His next present al­so con­tained can­dy — a large box of Choco­late Frogs from Hermione.

This on­ly left one par­cel. Har­ry picked it up and felt it. It was very light. He un­wrapped it.

Some­thing flu­id and sil­very gray went slith­er­ing to the floor where it lay in gleam­ing folds. Ron gasped.

“I’ve heard of those,” he said in a hushed voice, drop­ping the box of Ev­ery Fla­vor Beans he’d got­ten from Hermione. “If that’s what I think it is — they’re re­al­ly rare, and re­al­ly valu­able.”

“What is it?”

Har­ry picked the shin­ing, sil­very cloth off the floor. It was strange to the touch, like wa­ter wo­ven in­to ma­te­ri­al.

“It’s an in­vis­ibil­ity cloak,” said Ron, a look of awe on his face. “I’m sure it is — try it on.”

Har­ry threw the cloak around his shoul­ders and Ron gave a yell.

“It is! Look down!”

Har­ry looked down at his feet, but they were gone. He dashed to the mir­ror. Sure enough, his re­flec­tion looked back at him, just his head sus­pend­ed in midair, his body com­plete­ly in­vis­ible. He pulled the cloak over his head and his re­flec­tion van­ished com­plete­ly.

“There’s a note!” said Ron sud­den­ly. “A note fell out of it!”

Har­ry pulled off the cloak and seized the let­ter. Writ­ten in nar­row, loopy writ­ing he had nev­er seen be­fore were the fol­low­ing words:



Your fa­ther left this in my pos­ses­sion be­fore he died.

It is time it was re­turned to you.

Use it well.

A Very Mer­ry Christ­mas to you.



There was no sig­na­ture. Har­ry stared at the note. Ron was ad­mir­ing the cloak.

“I’d give any­thing for one of these,” he said. “Any­thing. What’s the mat­ter?”

“Noth­ing,” said Har­ry. He felt very strange. Who had sent the cloak? Had it re­al­ly once be­longed to his fa­ther?

Be­fore he could say or think any­thing else, the dor­mi­to­ry door was flung open and Fred and George Weasley bound­ed in. Har­ry stuffed the cloak quick­ly out of sight. He didn’t feel like shar­ing it with any­one else yet.

“Mer­ry Christ­mas!”

“Hey, look — Har­ry’s got a Weasley sweater, too!”

Fred and George were wear­ing blue sweaters, one with a large yel­low F on it, the oth­er a G.

“Har­ry’s is bet­ter than ours, though,” said Fred, hold­ing up Har­ry’s sweater. “She ob­vi­ous­ly makes more of an ef­fort if you’re not fam­ily.”

“Why aren’t you wear­ing yours, Ron?” George de­mand­ed. “Come on, get it on, they’re love­ly and warm.”

“I hate ma­roon,” Ron moaned half­heart­ed­ly as he pulled it over his head.

“You haven’t got a let­ter on yours,” George ob­served. “I sup­pose she thinks you don’t for­get your name. But we’re not stupid — we know we’re called Gred and Forge.”

“What’s all this noise?”

Per­cy Weasley stuck his head through the door, look­ing dis­ap­prov­ing. He had clear­ly got­ten halfway through un­wrap­ping his presents as he, too, car­ried a lumpy sweater over his arm, which Fred seized.

“P for pre­fect! Get it on, Per­cy, come on, we’re all wear­ing ours, even Har­ry got one.”

“I — don’t — want —” said Per­cy thick­ly, as the twins forced the sweater over his head, knock­ing his glass­es askew.

“And you’re not sit­ting with the pre­fects to­day, ei­ther,” said George. “Christ­mas is a time for fam­ily.”

They frog-​marched Per­cy from the room, his arms pinned to his side by his sweater.



Har­ry had nev­er in all his life had such a Christ­mas din­ner. A hun­dred fat, roast turkeys; moun­tains of roast and boiled pota­toes; plat­ters of chipo­latas; tureens of but­tered peas, sil­ver boats of thick, rich gravy and cran­ber­ry sauce – and stacks of wiz­ard crack­ers ev­ery few feet along the ta­ble. These fan­tas­tic par­ty fa­vors were noth­ing like the fee­ble Mug­gle ones the Durs­leys usu­al­ly bought, with their lit­tle plas­tic toys and their flim­sy pa­per hats in­side. Har­ry pulled a wiz­ard crack­er with Fred and it didn’t just bang, it went off with a blast like a can­non and en­gulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from the in­side ex­plod­ed a rear ad­mi­ral’s hat and sev­er­al live, white mice. Up at the High Ta­ble, Dum­ble­dore had swapped his point­ed wiz­ard’s hat for a flow­ered bon­net, and was chuck­ling mer­ri­ly at a joke Pro­fes­sor Flitwick had just read him.

Flam­ing Christ­mas pud­dings fol­lowed the turkey. Per­cy near­ly broke his teeth on a sil­ver sick­le em­bed­ded in his slice. Har­ry watched Ha­grid get­ting red­der and red­der in the face as he called for more wine, fi­nal­ly kiss­ing Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall on the cheek, who, to Har­ry’s amaze­ment, gig­gled and blushed, her top hat lop­sid­ed.

When Har­ry fi­nal­ly left the ta­ble, he was laden down with a stack of things out of the crack­ers, in­clud­ing a pack of non­ex­plod­able, lu­mi­nous bal­loons, a Grow-​Your-​Own-​Warts kit, and his own new wiz­ard chess set. The white mice had dis­ap­peared and Har­ry had a nasty feel­ing they were go­ing to end up as Mrs. Nor­ris’s Christ­mas din­ner.

Har­ry and the Weasleys spent a hap­py af­ter­noon hav­ing a fu­ri­ous snow­ball fight on the grounds. Then, cold, wet, and gasp­ing for breath, they re­turned to the fire in the Gryffind­or com­mon room, where Har­ry broke in his new chess set by los­ing spec­tac­ular­ly to Ron. He sus­pect­ed he wouldn’t have lost so bad­ly if Per­cy hadn’t tried to help him so much.

Af­ter a meal of turkey sand­wich­es, crum­pets, tri­fle, and Christ­mas cake, ev­ery­one felt too full and sleepy to do much be­fore bed ex­cept sit and watch Per­cy chase Fred and George all over Gryffind­or tow­er be­cause they’d stolen his pre­fect badge.

It had been Har­ry’s best Christ­mas day ev­er. Yet some­thing had been nag­ging at the back of his mind all day. Not un­til he climbed in­to bed was he free to think about it: the in­vis­ibil­ity cloak and who­ev­er had sent it.

Ron, full of turkey and cake and with noth­ing mys­te­ri­ous to both­er him, fell asleep al­most as soon as he’d drawn the cur­tains of his four-​poster. Har­ry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from un­der it.

His fa­ther’s…this had been his fa­ther’s. He let the ma­te­ri­al flow over his hands, smoother than silk, light as air. Use it well, the note had said.

He had to try it, now. He slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak around him­self. Look­ing down at his legs, he saw on­ly moon­light and shad­ows. It was a very fun­ny feel­ing.

Use it well.

Sud­den­ly, Har­ry felt wide-​awake. The whole of Hog­warts was open to him in this cloak. Ex­cite­ment flood­ed through him as he stood there in the dark and si­lence. He could go any­where in this, any­where, and Filch would nev­er know.

Ron grunt­ed in his sleep. Should Har­ry wake him? Some­thing held him back — his fa­ther’s cloak — he felt that this time — the first time — he want­ed to use it alone.

He crept out of the dor­mi­to­ry, down the stairs, across the com­mon room, and climbed through the por­trait hole.

“Who’s there?” squawked the Fat La­dy. Har­ry said noth­ing. He walked quick­ly down the cor­ri­dor.

Where should he go? He stopped, his heart rac­ing, and thought. And then it came to him. The Re­strict­ed Sec­tion in the li­brary. He’d be able to read as long as he liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel was. He set off, draw­ing the in­vis­ibil­ity cloak tight around him as he walked.

The li­brary was pitch-​black and very eerie. Har­ry lit a lamp to see his way along the rows of books. The lamp looked as if it was float­ing along in midair, and even though Har­ry could feel his arm sup­port­ing it, the sight gave him the creeps.

The Re­strict­ed Sec­tion was right at the back of the li­brary. Step­ping care­ful­ly over the rope that sep­arat­ed these books from the rest of the li­brary, he held up his lamp to read the ti­tles.

They didn’t tell him much. Their peel­ing, fad­ed gold let­ters spelled words in lan­guages Har­ry couldn’t un­der­stand. Some had no ti­tle at all. One book had a dark stain on it that looked hor­ri­bly like blood. The hairs on the back of Har­ry’s neck prick­led. Maybe he was imag­in­ing it, maybe not, but he thought a faint whis­per­ing was com­ing from the books, as though they knew some­one was there who shouldn’t be.

He had to start some­where. Set­ting the lamp down care­ful­ly on the floor, he looked along the bot­tom shelf for an in­ter­est­ing look­ing book. A large black and sil­ver vol­ume caught his eye. He pulled it out with dif­fi­cul­ty, be­cause it was very heavy, and, bal­anc­ing it on his knee, let it fall open.

A pierc­ing, blood­cur­dling shriek split the si­lence — the book was scream­ing! Har­ry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and on, one high, un­bro­ken, ear­split­ting note. He stum­bled back­ward and knocked over his lamp, which went out at once. Pan­ick­ing, he heard foot­steps com­ing down the cor­ri­dor out­side — stuff­ing the shriek­ing book back on the shelf, he ran for it. He passed Filch in the door­way; Filch’s pale, wild eyes looked straight through him, and Har­ry slipped un­der Filch’s out­stretched arm and streaked off up the cor­ri­dor, the book’s shrieks still ring­ing in his ears.

He came to a sud­den halt in front of a tall suit of ar­mor. He had been so busy get­ting away from the li­brary, he hadn’t paid at­ten­tion to where he was go­ing. Per­haps be­cause it was dark, he didn’t rec­og­nize where he was at all. There was a suit of ar­mor near the kitchens, he knew, but he must be five floors above there.

“You asked me to come di­rect­ly to you, Pro­fes­sor, if any­one was wan­der­ing around at night, and some­body’s been in the li­brary Re­strict­ed Sec­tion.”

Har­ry felt the blood drain out of his face. Wher­ev­er he was, Filch must know a short­cut, be­cause his soft, greasy voice was get­ting near­er, and to his hor­ror, it was Snape who replied, “The Re­strict­ed Sec­tion? Well, they can’t be far, we’ll catch them.”

Har­ry stood root­ed to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the cor­ner ahead. They couldn’t see him, of course, but it was a nar­row cor­ri­dor and if they came much near­er they’d knock right in­to him — the cloak didn’t stop him from be­ing sol­id.

He backed away as qui­et­ly as he could. A door stood ajar to his left. It was his on­ly hope. He squeezed through it, hold­ing his breath, try­ing not to move it, and to his re­lief he man­aged to get in­side the room with­out their notic­ing any­thing. They walked straight past, and Har­ry leaned against the wall, breath­ing deeply, lis­ten­ing to their foot­steps dy­ing away. That had been close, very close. It was a few sec­onds be­fore he no­ticed any­thing about the room he had hid­den in.

It looked like an un­used class­room. The dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls, and there was an up­turned wastepa­per bas­ket – but propped against the wall fac­ing him was some­thing that didn’t look as if it be­longed there, some­thing that looked as if some­one had just put it there to keep it out of the way.

It was a mag­nif­icent mir­ror, as high as the ceil­ing, with an or­nate gold frame, stand­ing on two clawed feet. There was an in­scrip­tion carved around the top: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. His pan­ic fad­ing now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape, Har­ry moved near­er to the mir­ror, want­ing to look at him­self but see no re­flec­tion again. He stepped in front of it.

He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop him­self from scream­ing. He whirled around. His heart was pound­ing far more fu­ri­ous­ly than when the book had screamed — for he had seen not on­ly him­self in the mir­ror, but a whole crowd of peo­ple stand­ing right be­hind him.

But the room was emp­ty. Breath­ing very fast, he turned slow­ly back to the mir­ror.

There he was, re­flect­ed in it, white and scared-​look­ing, and there, re­flect­ed be­hind him, were at least ten oth­ers. Har­ry looked over his shoul­der — but still, no one was there. Or were they all in­vis­ible, too? Was he in fact in a room full of in­vis­ible peo­ple and this mir­ror’s trick was that it re­flect­ed them, in­vis­ible or not?

He looked in the mir­ror again. A wom­an stand­ing right be­hind his re­flec­tion was smil­ing at him and wav­ing. He reached out a hand and felt the air be­hind him. If she was re­al­ly there, he’d touch her, their re­flec­tions were so close to­geth­er, but he felt on­ly air – she and the oth­ers ex­ist­ed on­ly in the mir­ror.

She was a very pret­ty wom­an. She had dark red hair and her eyes — her eyes are just like mine, Har­ry thought, edg­ing a lit­tle clos­er to the glass. Bright green — ex­act­ly the same shape, but then he no­ticed that she was cry­ing; smil­ing, but cry­ing at the same time. The tall, thin, black-​haired man stand­ing next to her put his arm around her. He wore glass­es, and his hair was very un­tidy. It stuck up at the back, just as Har­ry’s did.

Har­ry was so close to the mir­ror now that his nose was near­ly touch­ing that of his re­flec­tion.

“Mom?” he whis­pered. “Dad?”

They just looked at him, smil­ing. And slow­ly, Har­ry looked in­to the faces of the oth­er peo­ple in the mir­ror, and saw oth­er pairs of green eyes like his, oth­er noses like his, even a lit­tle old man who looked as though he had Har­ry’s knob­bly knees — Har­ry was look­ing at his fam­ily, for the first time in his life.

The Pot­ters smiled and waved at Har­ry and he stared hun­gri­ly back at them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hop­ing to fall right through it and reach them. He had a pow­er­ful kind of ache in­side him, half joy, half ter­ri­ble sad­ness.

How long he stood there, he didn’t know. The re­flec­tions did not fade and he looked and looked un­til a dis­tant noise brought him back to his sens­es. He couldn’t stay here, he had to find his way back to bed. He tore his eyes away from his moth­er’s face, whis­pered, “I’ll come back,” and hur­ried from the room.



“You could have wo­ken me up,” said Ron, cross­ly.

“You can come tonight, I’m go­ing back, I want to show you the mir­ror.

“I’d like to see your mom and dad,” Ron said ea­ger­ly.

“And I want to see all your fam­ily, all the Weasleys, you’ll be able to show me your oth­er broth­ers and ev­ery­one.”

“You can see them any old time,” said Ron. “Just come round my house this sum­mer. Any­way, maybe it on­ly shows dead peo­ple. Shame about not find­ing Flamel, though. Have some ba­con or some­thing, why aren’t you eat­ing any­thing?”

Har­ry couldn’t eat. He had seen his par­ents and would be see­ing them again tonight. He had al­most for­got­ten about Flamel. It didn’t seem very im­por­tant any­more. Who cared what the three head­ed dog was guard­ing? What did it mat­ter if Snape stole it, re­al­ly?

“Are you all right?” said Ron. “You look odd.”



What Har­ry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mir­ror room again. With Ron cov­ered in the cloak, too, they had to walk much more slow­ly the next night. They tried re­trac­ing Har­ry’s route from the li­brary, wan­der­ing around the dark pas­sage­ways for near­ly an hour.

“I’m freez­ing,” said Ron. “Let’s for­get it and go back.”

“No!” Har­ry hissed. I know it’s here some­where.”

They passed the ghost of a tall witch glid­ing in the op­po­site di­rec­tion, but saw no one else. just as Ron start­ed moan­ing that his feet were dead with cold, Har­ry spot­ted the suit of ar­mor.

“It’s here — just here — yes!”

They pushed the door open. Har­ry dropped the cloak from around his shoul­ders and ran to the mir­ror.

There they were. His moth­er and fa­ther beamed at the sight of him.

“See?” Har­ry whis­pered.

“I can’t see any­thing.”

“Look! Look at them all…there are loads of them.…”

“I can on­ly see you.”

“Look in it prop­er­ly, go on, stand where I am.”

Har­ry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mir­ror, he couldn’t see his fam­ily any­more, just Ron in his pais­ley pa­ja­mas.

Ron, though, was star­ing trans­fixed at his im­age.

“Look at me!” he said.

“Can you see all your fam­ily stand­ing around you?”

“No — I’m alone — but I’m dif­fer­ent — I look old­er — and I’m head boy!”

“What?”

“I am — I’m wear­ing the badge like Bill used to — and I’m hold­ing the house cup and the Quid­ditch cup — I’m Quid­ditch cap­tain, too.”

Ron tore his eyes away from this splen­did sight to look ex­cit­ed­ly at Har­ry.

“Do you think this mir­ror shows the fu­ture?”

“How can it? All my fam­ily are dead — let me have an­oth­er look —”

“You had it to your­self all last night, give me a bit more time.”

“You’re on­ly hold­ing the Quid­ditch cup, what’s in­ter­est­ing about that? I want to see my par­ents.”

“Don’t push me —”

A sud­den noise out­side in the cor­ri­dor put an end to their dis­cus­sion. They hadn’t re­al­ized how loud­ly they had been talk­ing.

“Quick!”

Ron threw the cloak back over them as the lu­mi­nous eyes of Mrs. Nor­ris came round the door. Ron and Har­ry stood quite still, both think­ing the same thing — did the cloak work on cats? Af­ter what seemed an age, she turned and left.

“This isn’t safe — she might have gone for Filch, I bet she heard us. Come on.”

And Ron pulled Har­ry out of the room.



The snow still hadn’t melt­ed the next morn­ing.

“Want to play chess, Har­ry?” said Ron.

“No.”

“Why don’t we go down and vis­it Ha­grid?”

“No…you go…”

“I know what you’re think­ing about, Har­ry, that mir­ror. Don’t go back tonight.”

“Why not?”

“I dun­no, I’ve just got a bad feel­ing about it — and any­way, you’ve had too many close shaves al­ready. Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Nor­ris are wan­der­ing around. So what if they can’t see you? What if they walk in­to you? What if you knock some­thing over?”

“You sound like Hermione.”

“I’m se­ri­ous, Har­ry, don’t go.”

But Har­ry on­ly had one thought in his head, which was to get back in front of the mir­ror, and Ron wasn’t go­ing to stop him.



That third night he found his way more quick­ly than be­fore. He was walk­ing so fast he knew he was mak­ing more noise than was wise, but he didn’t meet any­one.

And there were his moth­er and fa­ther smil­ing at him again, and one of his grand­fa­thers nod­ding hap­pi­ly. Har­ry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mir­ror. There was noth­ing to stop him from stay­ing here all night with his fam­ily. Noth­ing at all.

Ex­cept —

“So — back again, Har­ry?”

Har­ry felt as though his in­sides had turned to ice. He looked be­hind him. Sit­ting on one of the desks by the wall was none oth­er than Al­bus Dum­ble­dore. Har­ry must have walked straight past him, so des­per­ate to get to the mir­ror he hadn’t no­ticed him.

“I — I didn’t see you, sir.”

“Strange how near­sight­ed be­ing in­vis­ible can make you,” said Dum­ble­dore, and Har­ry was re­lieved to see that he was smil­ing.

“So,” said Dum­ble­dore, slip­ping off the desk to sit on the floor with Har­ry, “you, like hun­dreds be­fore you, have dis­cov­ered the de­lights of the Mir­ror of Erised.”

“I didn’t know it was called that, Sir.”

“But I ex­pect you’ve re­al­ized by now what it does?”

“It — well — it shows me my fam­ily —”

“And it showed your friend Ron him­self as head boy.”

“How did you know —?”

“I don’t need a cloak to be­come in­vis­ible,” said Dum­ble­dore gen­tly. “Now, can you think what the Mir­ror of Erised shows us all?”

Har­ry shook his head.

“Let me ex­plain. The hap­pi­est man on earth would be able to use the Mir­ror of Erised like a nor­mal mir­ror, that is, he would look in­to it and see him­self ex­act­ly as he is. Does that help?”

Har­ry thought. Then he said slow­ly, “It shows us what we want…what­ev­er we want…”

“Yes and no,” said Dum­ble­dore qui­et­ly. “It shows us noth­ing more or less than the deep­est, most des­per­ate de­sire of our hearts. You, who have nev­er known your fam­ily, see them stand­ing around you. Ronald Weasley, who has al­ways been over­shad­owed by his broth­ers, sees him­self stand­ing alone, the best of all of them. How­ev­er, this mir­ror will give us nei­ther knowl­edge or truth. Men have wast­ed away be­fore it, en­tranced by what they have seen, or been driv­en mad, not know­ing if what it shows is re­al or even pos­si­ble.

“The Mir­ror will be moved to a new home to­mor­row, Har­ry, and I ask you not to go look­ing for it again. If you ev­er do run across it, you will now be pre­pared. It does not do to dwell on dreams and for­get to live, re­mem­ber that. Now, why don’t you put that ad­mirable cloak back on and get off to bed?”

Har­ry stood up.

“Sir — Pro­fes­sor Dum­ble­dore? Can I ask you some­thing?”

“Ob­vi­ous­ly, you’ve just done so,” Dum­ble­dore smiled. “You may ask me one more thing, how­ev­er.”

“What do you see when you look in the mir­ror?”

“I? I see my­self hold­ing a pair of thick, woolen socks.”

Har­ry stared.

“One can nev­er have enough socks,” said Dum­ble­dore. “An­oth­er Christ­mas has come and gone and I didn’t get a sin­gle pair. Peo­ple will in­sist on giv­ing me books.”

It was on­ly when he was back in bed that it struck Har­ry that Dum­ble­dore might not have been quite truth­ful. But then, he thought, as he shoved Scab­bers off his pil­low, it had been quite a per­son­al ques­tion.

CHAPTER THIRTEEN




NICHOLAS FLAMEL



D um­ble­dore had con­vinced Har­ry not to go look­ing for the Mir­ror of Erised again, and for the rest of the Christ­mas hol­idays the in­vis­ibil­ity cloak stayed fold­ed at the bot­tom of his trunk. Har­ry wished he could for­get what he’d seen in the mir­ror as eas­ily, but he couldn’t. He start­ed hav­ing night­mares. Over and over again he dreamed about his par­ents dis­ap­pear­ing in a flash of green light, while a high voice cack­led with laugh­ter.

“You see, Dum­ble­dore was right, that mir­ror could drive you mad,” said Ron, when Har­ry told him about these dreams.

Hermione, who came back the day be­fore term start­ed, took a dif­fer­ent view of things. She was torn be­tween hor­ror at the idea of Har­ry be­ing out of bed, roam­ing the school three nights in a row (“If Filch had caught you!”), and dis­ap­point­ment that he hadn’t at least found out who Nico­las Flamel was.

They had al­most giv­en up hope of ev­er find­ing Flamel in a li­brary book, even though Har­ry was still sure he’d read the name some­where. Once term had start­ed, they were back to skim­ming through books for ten min­utes dur­ing their breaks. Har­ry had even less time than the oth­er two, be­cause Quid­ditch prac­tice had start­ed again.

Wood was work­ing the team hard­er than ev­er. Even the end­less rain that had re­placed the snow couldn’t damp­en his spir­its. The Weasleys com­plained that Wood was be­com­ing a fa­nat­ic, but Har­ry was on Wood’s side. If they won their next match, against Huf­flepuff, they would over­take Slytherin in the house cham­pi­onship for the first time in sev­en years. Quite apart from want­ing to win, Har­ry found that he had few­er night­mares when he was tired out af­ter train­ing.

Then, dur­ing one par­tic­ular­ly wet and mud­dy prac­tice ses­sion, Wood gave the team a bit of bad news. He’d just got­ten very an­gry with the Weasleys, who kept dive-​bomb­ing each oth­er and pre­tend­ing to fall off their brooms.

“Will you stop mess­ing around!” he yelled. “That’s ex­act­ly the sort of thing that’ll lose us the match! Snape’s ref­er­ee­ing this time, and he’ll be look­ing for any ex­cuse to knock points off Gryffind­or!”

George Weasley re­al­ly did fall off his broom at these words.

“Snape’s ref­er­ee­ing?” he splut­tered through a mouth­ful of mud. “When’s he ev­er ref­er­eed a Quid­ditch match? He’s not go­ing to be fair if we might over­take Slytherin.”

The rest of the team land­ed next to George to com­plain, too.

“It’s not my fault,” said Wood. “We’ve just got to make sure we play a clean game, so Snape hasn’t got an ex­cuse to pick on us.”

Which was all very well, thought Har­ry, but he had an­oth­er rea­son for not want­ing Snape near him while he was play­ing Quid­ditch.…

The rest of the team hung back to talk to one an­oth­er as usu­al at the end of prac­tice, but Har­ry head­ed straight back to the Gryffind­or com­mon room, where he found Ron and Hermione play­ing chess. Chess was the on­ly thing Hermione ev­er lost at, some­thing Har­ry and Ron thought was very good for her.

“Don’t talk to me for a mo­ment,” said Ron when Har­ry sat down next to him, “I need to con­cen—” He caught sight of Har­ry’s face.

“What’s the mat­ter with you? You look ter­ri­ble.”

Speak­ing qui­et­ly so that no one else would hear, Har­ry told the oth­er two about Snape’s sud­den, sin­is­ter de­sire to be a Quid­ditch ref­er­ee.

“Don’t play,” said Hermione at once.

“Say you’re ill,” said Ron.

“Pre­tend to break your leg,” Hermione sug­gest­ed.

“Re­al­ly break your leg,” said Ron.

“I can’t,” said Har­ry. “There isn’t a re­serve Seek­er. If I back out, Gryffind­or can’t play at all.”

At that mo­ment Neville top­pled in­to the com­mon room. How he had man­aged to climb through the por­trait hole was any­one’s guess, be­cause his legs had been stuck to­geth­er with what they rec­og­nized at once as the Leg-​Lock­er Curse. He must have had to bun­ny hop all the way up to Gryffind­or tow­er.

Ev­ery­one fell over laugh­ing ex­cept Hermione, who leapt up and per­formed the coun­ter­curse. Neville’s legs sprang apart and he got to his feet, trem­bling. “What hap­pened?” Hermione asked him, lead­ing him over to sit with Har­ry and Ron.

“Mal­foy,” said Neville shak­ily. “I met him out­side the li­brary. He said he’d been look­ing for some­one to prac­tice that on.”

“Go to Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall!” Hermione urged Neville. “Re­port him!”

Neville shook his head.

“I don’t want more trou­ble,” he mum­bled.

“You’ve got to stand up to him, Neville!” said Ron. “He’s used to walk­ing all over peo­ple, but that’s no rea­son to lie down in front of him and make it eas­ier.”

“There’s no need to tell me I’m not brave enough to be in Gryffind­or, Mal­foy’s al­ready done that,” Neville choked out.

Har­ry felt in the pock­et of his robes and pulled out a Choco­late Frog, the very last one from the box Hermione had giv­en him for Christ­mas. He gave it to Neville, who looked as though he might cry.

“You’re worth twelve of Mal­foy,” Har­ry said. “The Sort­ing Hat chose you for Gryffind­or, didn’t it? And where’s Mal­foy? In stink­ing Slytherin.”

Neville’s lips twitched in a weak smile as he un­wrapped the frog.

“Thanks, Har­ry…I think I’ll go to bed.…D’you want the card, you col­lect them, don’t you?”

As Neville walked away, Har­ry looked at the Fa­mous Wiz­ard card.

“Dum­ble­dore again,” he said, “He was the first one I ev­er —”

He gasped. He stared at the back of the card. Then he looked up at Ron and Hermione.

“I’ve found him!” he whis­pered. “I’ve found Flamel! I told you I’d read the name some­where be­fore, I read it on the train com­ing here — lis­ten to this: ‘Dum­ble­dore is par­tic­ular­ly fa­mous for his de­feat of the dark wiz­ard Grindel­wald in 1945, for the dis­cov­ery of the twelve us­es of drag­on’s blood, and his work on alche­my with his part­ner, Nico­las Flamel’!”

Hermione jumped to her feet. She hadn’t looked so ex­cit­ed since they’d got­ten back the marks for their very first piece of home­work.

“Stay there!” she said, and she sprint­ed up the stairs to the girls’ dor­mi­to­ries. Har­ry and Ron bare­ly had time to ex­change mys­ti­fied looks be­fore she was dash­ing back, an enor­mous old book in her arms.

“I nev­er thought to look in here!” she whis­pered ex­cit­ed­ly. “I got this out of the li­brary weeks ago for a bit of light read­ing.”

“Light?” said Ron, but Hermione told him to be qui­et un­til she’d looked some­thing up, and start­ed flick­ing fran­ti­cal­ly through the pages, mut­ter­ing to her­self.

At last she found what she was look­ing for.

“I knew it! I knew it!”

“Are we al­lowed to speak yet?” said Ron grumpi­ly. Hermione ig­nored him.

“Nico­las Flamel,” she whis­pered dra­mat­ical­ly, “is the on­ly known mak­er of the Sor­cer­er’s Stone!”

This didn’t have quite the ef­fect she’d ex­pect­ed.

“The what?” said Har­ry and Ron.

“Oh, hon­est­ly, don’t you two read? Look – read that, there.”

She pushed the book to­ward them, and Har­ry and Ron read:



The an­cient study of alche­my is con­cerned with mak­ing the Sor­cer­er’s Stone, a leg­endary sub­stance with as­ton­ish­ing pow­ers. The stone will trans­form any met­al in­to pure gold. It al­so pro­duces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker im­mor­tal.

There have been many re­ports of the Sor­cer­er’s Stone over the cen­turies, but the on­ly Stone cur­rent­ly in ex­is­tence be­longs to Mr. Nico­las Flamel, the not­ed al­chemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel, who cel­ebrat­ed his six hun­dred and six­ty-​fifth birth­day last year, en­joys a qui­et life in De­von with his wife, Perenelle (six hun­dred and fifty-​eight).



“See?” said Hermione, when Har­ry and Ron had fin­ished. “The dog must be guard­ing Flamel’s Sor­cer­er’s Stone! I bet he asked Dum­ble­dore to keep it safe for him, be­cause they’re friends and he knew some­one was af­ter it, that’s why he want­ed the Stone moved out of Gringotts!”

“A stone that makes gold and stops you from ev­er dy­ing!” said Har­ry. “No won­der Snape’s af­ter it! Any­one would want it.”

“And no won­der we couldn’t find Flamel in that Study of Re­cent De­vel­op­ments in Wiz­ardry,” said Ron. “He’s not ex­act­ly re­cent if he’s six hun­dred and six­ty-​five, is he?”



The next morn­ing in De­fense Against the Dark Arts, while copy­ing down dif­fer­ent ways of treat­ing were­wolf bites, Har­ry and Ron were still dis­cussing what they’d do with a Sor­cer­er’s Stone if they had one. It wasn’t un­til Ron said he’d buy his own Quid­ditch team that Har­ry re­mem­bered about Snape and the com­ing match.

“I’m go­ing to play,” he told Ron and Hermione. “If I don’t, all the Slytherins will think I’m just too scared to face Snape. I’ll show them…it’ll re­al­ly wipe the smiles off their faces if we win.”

“Just as long as we’re not wip­ing you off the field,” said Hermione.



As the match drew near­er, how­ev­er, Har­ry be­came more and more ner­vous, what­ev­er he told Ron and Hermione. The rest of the team wasn’t too calm, ei­ther. The idea of over­tak­ing Slytherin in the house cham­pi­onship was won­der­ful, no one had done it for sev­en years, but would they be al­lowed to, with such a bi­ased ref­er­ee?

Har­ry didn’t know whether he was imag­in­ing it or not, but he seemed to keep run­ning in­to Snape wher­ev­er he went. At times, he even won­dered whether Snape was fol­low­ing him, try­ing to catch him on his own. Po­tions lessons were turn­ing in­to a sort of week­ly tor­ture, Snape was so hor­ri­ble to Har­ry. Could Snape pos­si­bly know they’d found out about the Sor­cer­er’s Stone? Har­ry didn’t see how he could — yet he some­times had the hor­ri­ble feel­ing that Snape could read minds.



Har­ry knew, when they wished him good luck out­side the lock­er rooms the next af­ter­noon, that Ron and Hermione were won­der­ing whether they’d ev­er see him alive again. This wasn’t what you’d call com­fort­ing. Har­ry hard­ly heard a word of Wood’s pep talk as he pulled on his Quid­ditch robes and picked up his Nim­bus Two Thou­sand.

Ron and Hermione, mean­while, had found a place in the stands next to Neville, who couldn’t un­der­stand why they looked so grim and wor­ried, or why they had both brought their wands to the match. Lit­tle did Har­ry know that Ron and Hermione had been se­cret­ly prac­tic­ing the Leg-​Lock­er Curse. They’d got­ten the idea from Mal­foy us­ing it on Neville, and were ready to use it on Snape if he showed any sign of want­ing to hurt Har­ry.

“Now, don’t for­get, it’s Lo­co­mo­tor Mor­tis,” Hermione mut­tered as Ron slipped his wand up his sleeve.

“I know,” Ron snapped. “Don’t nag.”

Back in the lock­er room, Wood had tak­en Har­ry aside.

“Don’t want to pres­sure you, Pot­ter, but if we ev­er need an ear­ly cap­ture of the Snitch it’s now. Fin­ish the game be­fore Snape can fa­vor Huf­flepuff too much.”

“The whole school’s out there!” said Fred Weasley, peer­ing out of the door. “Even — blimey — Dum­ble­dore’s come to watch!”

Har­ry’s heart did a som­er­sault.

“Dum­ble­dore?” he said, dash­ing to the door to make sure. Fred was right. There was no mis­tak­ing that sil­ver beard.

Har­ry could have laughed out loud with re­lief He was safe. There was sim­ply no way that Snape would dare to try to hurt him if Dum­ble­dore was watch­ing.

Per­haps that was why Snape was look­ing so an­gry as the teams marched on­to the field, some­thing that Ron no­ticed, too.

“I’ve nev­er seen Snape look so mean,” he told Hermione. “Look — they’re off. Ouch!”

Some­one had poked Ron in the back of the head. It was Mal­foy.

“Oh, sor­ry, Weasley, didn’t see you there.”

Mal­foy grinned broad­ly at Crabbe and Goyle.

“Won­der how long Pot­ter’s go­ing to stay on his broom this time? Any­one want a bet? What about you, Weasley?”

Ron didn’t an­swer; Snape had just award­ed Huf­flepuff a penal­ty be­cause George Weasley had hit a Bludger at him. Hermione, who had all her fin­gers crossed in her lap, was squint­ing fixed­ly at Har­ry, who was cir­cling the game like a hawk, look­ing for the Snitch.

“You know how I think they choose peo­ple for the Gryffind­or team?” said Mal­foy loud­ly a few min­utes lat­er, as Snape award­ed Huf­flepuff an­oth­er penal­ty for no rea­son at all. “It’s peo­ple they feel sor­ry for. See, there’s Pot­ter, who’s got no par­ents, then there’s the Weasleys, who’ve got no mon­ey — you should be on the team, Long­bot­tom, you’ve got no brains.”

Neville went bright red but turned in his seat to face Mal­foy.

“I’m worth twelve of you, Mal­foy,” he stam­mered.

Mal­foy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laugh­ter, but Ron, still not dar­ing to take his eyes from the game, said, “You tell him, Neville.”

“Long­bot­tom, if brains were gold you’d be poor­er than Weasley, and that’s say­ing some­thing.”

Ron’s nerves were al­ready stretched to the break­ing point with anx­iety about Har­ry.

“I’m warn­ing you, Mal­foy — one more word—”

“Ron!” said Hermione sud­den­ly, “Har­ry —”

“What? Where?”

Har­ry had sud­den­ly gone in­to a spec­tac­ular dive, which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd. Hermione stood up, her crossed fin­gers in her mouth, as Har­ry streaked to­ward the ground like a bul­let.

“You’re in luck, Weasley, Pot­ter’s ob­vi­ous­ly spot­ted some mon­ey on the ground!” said Mal­foy.

Ron snapped. Be­fore Mal­foy knew what was hap­pen­ing, Ron was on top of him, wrestling him to the ground. Neville hes­itat­ed, then clam­bered over the back of his seat to help.

“Come on, Har­ry!” Hermione screamed, leap­ing on­to her seat to watch as Har­ry sped straight at Snape — she didn’t even no­tice Mal­foy and Ron rolling around un­der her seat, or the scuf­fles and yelps com­ing from the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle.

Up in the air, Snape turned on his broom­stick just in time to see some­thing scar­let shoot past him, miss­ing him by inch­es — the next sec­ond, Har­ry had pulled out of the dive, his arm raised in tri­umph, the Snitch clasped in his hand.

The stands erupt­ed; it had to be a record, no one could ev­er re­mem­ber the Snitch be­ing caught so quick­ly.

“Ron! Ron! Where are you? The game’s over! Har­ry’s won! We’ve won! Gryffind­or is in the lead!” shrieked Hermione, danc­ing up and down on her seat and hug­ging Par­vati Patil in the row in front.

Har­ry jumped off his broom, a foot from the ground. He couldn’t be­lieve it. He’d done it — the game was over; it had bare­ly last­ed five min­utes. As Gryffind­ors came spilling on­to the field, he saw Snape land near­by, white-​faced and tight-​lipped — then Har­ry felt a hand on his shoul­der and looked up in­to Dum­ble­dore’s smil­ing face.

“Well done,” said Dum­ble­dore qui­et­ly, so that on­ly Har­ry could hear. “Nice to see you haven’t been brood­ing about that mir­ror...been keep­ing busy...ex­cel­lent...”

Snape spat bit­ter­ly on the ground.



Har­ry left the lock­er room alone some time lat­er, to take his Nim­bus Two Thou­sand back to the broomshed. He couldn’t ev­er re­mem­ber feel­ing hap­pi­er. He’d re­al­ly done some­thing to be proud of now – no one could say he was just a fa­mous name any more. The evening air had nev­er smelled so sweet. He walked over the damp grass, re­liv­ing the last hour in his head, which was a hap­py blur: Gryffind­ors run­ning to lift him on­to their shoul­ders; Ron and Hermione in the dis­tance, jump­ing up and down, Ron cheer­ing through a heavy nose­bleed.

Har­ry had reached the shed. He leaned against the wood­en door and looked up at Hog­warts, with its win­dows glow­ing red in the set­ting sun. Gryffind­or in the lead. He’d done it, he’d shown Snape ....

And speak­ing of Snape…

A hood­ed fig­ure came swift­ly down the front steps of the cas­tle. Clear­ly not want­ing to be seen, it walked as fast as pos­si­ble to­ward the for­bid­den for­est. Har­ry’s vic­to­ry fad­ed from his mind as he watched. He rec­og­nized the fig­ure’s prowl­ing walk. Snape, sneak­ing in­to the for­est while ev­ery­one else was at din­ner — what was go­ing on?

Har­ry jumped back on his Nim­bus Two Thou­sand and took off. Glid­ing silent­ly over the cas­tle he saw Snape en­ter the for­est at a run. He fol­lowed.

The trees were so thick he couldn’t see where Snape had gone. He flew in cir­cles, low­er and low­er, brush­ing the top branch­es of trees un­til he heard voic­es. He glid­ed to­ward them and land­ed noise­less­ly in a tow­er­ing beech tree.

He climbed care­ful­ly along one of the branch­es, hold­ing tight to his broom­stick, try­ing to see through the leaves.

Be­low, in a shad­owy clear­ing, stood Snape, but he wasn’t alone. Quir­rell was there, too. Har­ry couldn’t make out the look on his face, but he was stut­ter­ing worse than ev­er. Har­ry strained to catch what they were say­ing.

“…d-​don’t know why you want­ed t-​t-​to meet here of all p-​places, Severus…”

“Oh, I thought we’d keep this pri­vate,” said Snape, his voice icy. “Stu­dents aren’t sup­posed to know about the Sor­cer­er’s Stone, af­ter all.”

Har­ry leaned for­ward. Quir­rell was mum­bling some­thing. Snape in­ter­rupt­ed him.

“Have you found out how to get past that beast of Ha­grid’s yet?”

“B-​b-​but Severus, I —”

“You don’t want me as your en­emy, Quir­rell,” said Snape, tak­ing a step to­ward him.

“I-I don’t know what you—”

“You know per­fect­ly well what I mean.”

An owl hoot­ed loud­ly, and Har­ry near­ly fell out of the tree. He stead­ied him­self in time to hear Snape say, “— your lit­tle bit of ho­cus-​pocus. I’m wait­ing.”

“B-​but I d-​d-​don’t —”

“Very well,” Snape cut in. “We’ll have an­oth­er lit­tle chat soon, when you’ve had time to think things over and de­cid­ed where your loy­al­ties lie.”

He threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clear­ing. It was al­most dark now, but Har­ry could see Quir­rell, stand­ing quite still as though he was pet­ri­fied.



“Har­ry, where have you been?” Hermione squeaked.

“We won! You won! We won!” shout­ed Ron, thump­ing Har­ry on the back. “And I gave Mal­foy a black eye, and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle sin­gle-​hand­ed! He’s still out cold but Madam Pom­frey says he’ll be all right — talk about show­ing Slytherin! I’ve wait­ing for you in the com­mon room, we’re hav­ing a par­ty, Fred and George stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens.”

“Nev­er mind that now,” said Har­ry breath­less­ly. “Let’s find an emp­ty room, you wait ’til you hear this....”

He made sure Peeves wasn’t in­side be­fore shut­ting the door be­hind them, then he told them what he’d seen and heard.

“So we were right, it is the Sor­cer­er’s Stone, and Snape’s try­ing to force Quir­rell to help him get it. He asked if he knew how to get past Fluffy — and he said some­thing about Quir­rell’s ‘ho­cus pocus’ — I reck­on there are oth­er things guard­ing the stone apart from Fluffy, loads of en­chant­ments, prob­ably, and Quir­rell would have done some an­ti-​Dark Arts spell that Snape needs to break through —”

“So you mean the Stone’s on­ly safe as long as Quir­rell stands up to Snape?” said Hermione in alarm.

“It’ll be gone by next Tues­day,” said Ron.





HP 1 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone





CHAPTER FOURTEEN




NOR­BERT THE NOR­WE­GIAN RIDGE­BACK



Q uir­rell, how­ev­er, must have been braver than they’d thought. In the weeks that fol­lowed he did seem to be get­ting paler and thin­ner, but it didn’t look as though he’d cracked yet.

Ev­ery time they passed the third-​floor cor­ri­dor, Har­ry, Ron, and Hermione would press their ears to the door to check that Fluffy was still growl­ing in­side. Snape was sweep­ing about in his usu­al bad tem­per, which sure­ly meant that the Stone was still safe. When­ev­er Har­ry passed Quir­rell these days he gave him an en­cour­ag­ing sort of smile, and Ron had start­ed telling peo­ple off for laugh­ing at Quir­rell’s stut­ter.

Hermione, how­ev­er, had more on her mind than the Sor­cer­er’s Stone. She had start­ed draw­ing up study sched­ules and col­or cod­ing all her notes. Har­ry and Ron wouldn’t have mind­ed, but she kept nag­ging them to do the same.

“Hermione, the ex­ams are ages away.”

“Ten weeks,” Hermione snapped. “That’s not ages, that’s like a sec­ond to Nico­las Flamel.”

“But we’re not six hun­dred years old,” Ron re­mind­ed her. “Any­way, what are you study­ing for, you al­ready know it’s an A.”

“What am I study­ing for? Are you crazy? You re­al­ize we need to pass these ex­ams to get in­to the sec­ond year? They’re very im­por­tant, I should have start­ed study­ing a month ago, I don’t know what’s got­ten in­to me.…”

Un­for­tu­nate­ly, the teach­ers seemed to be think­ing along the same lines as Hermione. They piled so much home­work on them that the East­er hol­idays weren’t near­ly as much fun as the Christ­mas ones. It was hard to re­lax with Hermione next to you recit­ing the twelve us­es of drag­on’s blood or prac­tic­ing wand move­ments. Moan­ing and yawn­ing, Har­ry and Ron spent most of their free time in the li­brary with her, try­ing to get through all their ex­tra work.

“I’ll nev­er re­mem­ber this,” Ron burst out one af­ter­noon, throw­ing down his quill and look­ing long­ing­ly out of the li­brary win­dow. It was the first re­al­ly fine day they’d had in months. The sky was a clear, for­get-​me-​not blue, and there was a feel­ing in the air of sum­mer com­ing.

Har­ry, who was look­ing up “Dit­tany” in One Thou­sand Mag­ical Herbs and Fun­gi, didn’t look up un­til he heard Ron say, “Ha­grid! What are you do­ing in the li­brary?”

Ha­grid shuf­fled in­to view, hid­ing some­thing be­hind his back. He looked very out of place in his mole­skin over­coat.

“Jus’ lookin’,” he said, in a shifty voice that got their in­ter­est at once. “An’ what’re you lot up ter?” He looked sud­den­ly sus­pi­cious. “Yer not still lookin’ fer Nico­las Flamel, are yeh?”

“Oh, we found out who he is ages ago,” said Ron im­pres­sive­ly. “And we know what that dog’s guard­ing, it’s a Sor­cer­er’s St—”

“Shh­hh!” Ha­grid looked around quick­ly to see if any­one was lis­ten­ing. “Don’ go shoutin’ about it, what’s the mat­ter with yeh?”

“There are a few things we want­ed to ask you, as a mat­ter of fact,” said Har­ry, “about what’s guard­ing the Stone apart from Fluffy —”

“SHH­HH!” said Ha­grid again. “Lis­ten — come an’ see me lat­er, I’m not promisin’ I’ll tell yeh any­thin’, mind, but don’ go rab­bitin’ about it in here, stu­dents aren’ s’pposed ter know. They’ll think I’ve told yeh —”

“See you lat­er, then,” said Har­ry.

Ha­grid shuf­fled off.

“What was he hid­ing be­hind his back?” said Hermione thought­ful­ly.

“Do you think it had any­thing to do with the Stone?”

“I’m go­ing to see what sec­tion he was in,” said Ron, who’d had enough of work­ing. He came back a minute lat­er with a pile of books in his arms and slammed them down on the ta­ble.

“Drag­ons!” he whis­pered. “Ha­grid was look­ing up stuff about drag­ons! Look at these: Drag­on Species of Great Britain and Ire­land; From Egg to In­fer­no, A Drag­on Keep­er’s Guide.”

“Ha­grid’s al­ways want­ed a drag­on, he told me so the first time I ev­er met him, “ said Har­ry.

“But it’s against our laws,” said Ron. “Drag­on breed­ing was out­lawed by the War­locks’ Con­ven­tion of 1709, ev­ery­one knows that. It’s hard to stop Mug­gles from notic­ing us if we’re keep­ing drag­ons in the back gar­den — any­way, you can’t tame drag­ons, it’s dan­ger­ous. You should see the burns Char­lie’s got off wild ones in Ro­ma­nia.”

“But there aren’t wild drag­ons in Britain?” said Har­ry.

“Of course there are,” said Ron. “Com­mon Welsh Green and He­bridean Blacks. The Min­istry of Mag­ic has a job hush­ing them up, I can tell you. Our kind have to keep putting spells on Mug­gles who’ve spot­ted them, to make them for­get.”

“So what on earth’s Ha­grid up to?” said Hermione.



When they knocked on the door of the game­keep­er’s hut an hour lat­er, they were sur­prised to see that all the cur­tains were closed. Ha­grid called “Who is it?” be­fore he let them in, and then shut the door quick­ly be­hind them.

It was sti­fling hot in­side. Even though it was such a warm day, there was a blaz­ing fire in the grate. Ha­grid made them tea and of­fered them stoat sand­wich­es, which they re­fused.

“So — yeh want­ed to ask me some­thin’?”

“Yes,” said Har­ry. There was no point beat­ing around the bush. “We were won­der­ing if you could tell us what’s guard­ing the Sor­cer­er’s Stone apart from Fluffy.”

Ha­grid frowned at him.

“O’ course I can’t,“ he said. “Num­ber one, I don’ know me­self. Num­ber two, yeh know too much al­ready, so I wouldn’ tell yeh if I could. That Stone’s here fer a good rea­son. It was al­most stolen out­ta Gringotts — I s’ppose yeh’ve worked that out an’ all? Beats me how yeh even know abou’ Fluffy.”

“Oh, come on, Ha­grid, you might not want to tell us, but you do know, you know ev­ery­thing that goes on round here,” said Hermione in a warm, flat­ter­ing voice. Ha­grid’s beard twitched and they could tell he was smil­ing. “We on­ly won­dered who had done the guard­ing, re­al­ly.” Hermione went on. “We won­dered who Dum­ble­dore had trust­ed enough to help him, apart from you.”

Ha­grid’s chest swelled at these last words. Har­ry and Ron beamed at Hermione.

“Well, I don’ s’pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that…let’s see…he bor­rowed Fluffy from me…then some o’ the teach­ers did en­chant­ments…Pro­fes­sor Sprout — Pro­fes­sor Flitwick — Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall —” he ticked them off on his fin­gers, “Pro­fes­sor Quir­rell — an’ Dum­ble­dore him­self did some­thin’, o’ course. Hang on, I’ve for­got­ten some­one. Oh yeah, Pro­fes­sor Snape.”

“Snape?”

“Yeah — yer not still on abou’ that, are yeh? Look, Snape helped pro­tect the Stone, he’s not about ter steal it.”

Har­ry knew Ron and Hermione were think­ing the same as he was. If Snape had been in on pro­tect­ing the Stone, it must have been easy to find out how the oth­er teach­ers had guard­ed it. He prob­ably knew ev­ery­thing — ex­cept, it seemed, Quir­rell’s spell and how to get past Fluffy.

“You’re the on­ly one who knows how to get past Fluffy. aren’t you, Ha­grid?” said Har­ry anx­ious­ly. “And you wouldn’t tell any­one, would you? Not even one of the teach­ers?”

“Not a soul knows ex­cept me an’ Dum­ble­dore,” said Ha­grid proud­ly.

“Well, that’s some­thing,” Har­ry mut­tered to the oth­ers. “Ha­grid, can we have a win­dow open? I’m boil­ing.”

“Can’t, Har­ry, sor­ry,” said Ha­grid. Har­ry no­ticed him glance at the fire. Har­ry looked at it, too.

“Ha­grid — what’s that?”

But he al­ready knew what it was. In the very heart of the fire, un­der­neath the ket­tle, was a huge, black egg.

“Ah,” said Ha­grid, fid­dling ner­vous­ly with his beard, “That’s — er…”

“Where did you get it, Ha­grid?” said Ron, crouch­ing over the fire to get a clos­er look at the egg. “It must’ve cost you a for­tune.”

“Won it,” said Ha­grid. “Las’ night. I was down in the vil­lage havin’ a few drinks an’ got in­to a game o’ cards with a stranger. Think he was quite glad ter get rid of it, ter be hon­est.”

“But what are you go­ing to do with it when it’s hatched?” said Hermione.

“Well, I’ve bin doin’ some readin’,” said Ha­grid, pulling a large book from un­der his pil­low. “Got this out­ta the li­brary — Drag­on Breed­ing for Plea­sure and Prof­it — it’s a bit out­ta date, o’ course, but it’s all in here. Keep the egg in the fire, ‘cause their moth­ers breathe on I em, see, an’ when it hatch­es, feed it on a buck­et o’ brandy mixed with chick­en blood ev­ery half hour. An’ see here — how ter rec­og­nize diff’rent eggs — what I got there’s a Nor­we­gian Ridge­back. They’re rare, them.”

He looked very pleased with him­self, but Hermione didn’t.

“Ha­grid, you live in a wood­en house,” she said.

But Ha­grid wasn’t lis­ten­ing. He was hum­ming mer­ri­ly as he stoked the fire.



So now they had some­thing else to wor­ry about: what might hap­pen to Ha­grid if any­one found out he was hid­ing an il­le­gal drag­on in his hut.

“Won­der what it’s like to have a peace­ful life,” Ron sighed, as evening af­ter evening they strug­gled through all the ex­tra home­work they were get­ting. Hermione had now start­ed mak­ing study sched­ules for Har­ry and Ron, too. It was driv­ing them nuts.

Then, one break­fast time, Hed­wig brought Har­ry an­oth­er note from Ha­grid. He had writ­ten on­ly two words: It’s hatch­ing.

Ron want­ed to skip Her­bol­ogy and go straight down to the hut. Hermione wouldn’t hear of it.

“Hermione, how many times in our lives are we go­ing to see a drag­on hatch­ing?”

“We’ve got lessons, we’ll get in­to trou­ble, and that’s noth­ing to what Ha­grid’s go­ing to be in when some­one finds out what he’s do­ing—”

“Shut up!” Har­ry whis­pered.

Mal­foy was on­ly a few feet away and he had stopped dead to lis­ten. How much had he heard? Har­ry didn’t like the look on Mal­foy’s face at all.

Ron and Hermione ar­gued all the way to Her­bol­ogy and in the end, Hermione agreed to run down to Ha­grid’s with the oth­er two dur­ing morn­ing break. When the bell sound­ed from the cas­tle at the end of their les­son, the three of them dropped their trow­els at once and hur­ried through the grounds to the edge of the for­est. Ha­grid greet­ed them, look­ing flushed and ex­cit­ed.

“It’s near­ly out.” He ush­ered them in­side.

The egg was ly­ing on the ta­ble. There were deep cracks in it. Some­thing was mov­ing in­side; a fun­ny click­ing noise was com­ing from it.

They all drew their chairs up to the ta­ble and watched with bat­ed breath.

All at once there was a scrap­ing noise and the egg split open. The ba­by drag­on flopped on­to the ta­ble. It wasn’t ex­act­ly pret­ty; Har­ry thought it looked like a crum­pled, black um­brel­la. Its spiny wings were huge com­pared to its skin­ny jet body, it had a long snout with wide nos­trils, the stubs of horns and bulging, or­ange eyes.

It sneezed. A cou­ple of sparks flew out of its snout.

“Isn’t he beau­ti­ful?” Ha­grid mur­mured. He reached out a hand to stroke the drag­on’s head. It snapped at his fin­gers, show­ing point­ed fangs.

“Bless him, look, he knows his mom­my!” said Ha­grid.

“Ha­grid,” said Hermione, “how fast do Nor­we­gian Ridge­backs grow, ex­act­ly?”

Ha­grid was about to an­swer when the col­or sud­den­ly drained from his face — he leapt to his feet and ran to the win­dow.

“What’s the mat­ter?”

“Some­one was lookin’ through the gap in the cur­tains — it’s a kid — he’s run­nin’ back up ter the school.”

Har­ry bolt­ed to the door and looked out. Even at a dis­tance there was no mis­tak­ing him.

Mal­foy had seen the drag­on.



Some­thing about the smile lurk­ing on Mal­foy’s face dur­ing the next week made Har­ry, Ron, and Hermione very ner­vous. They spent most of their free time in Ha­grid’s dark­ened hut, try­ing to rea­son with him.

“Just let him go,” Har­ry urged. “Set him free.”

“I can’t,” said Ha­grid. “He’s too lit­tle. He’d die.”

They looked at the drag­on. It had grown three times in length in just a week. Smoke kept furl­ing out of its nos­trils. Ha­grid hadn’t been do­ing his game­keep­ing du­ties be­cause the drag­on was keep­ing him so busy. There were emp­ty brandy bot­tles and chick­en feath­ers all over the floor.

“I’ve de­cid­ed to call him Nor­bert,” said Ha­grid, look­ing at the drag­on with misty eyes. “He re­al­ly knows me now, watch. Nor­bert! Nor­bert! Where’s Mom­my?”

“He’s lost his mar­bles,” Ron mut­tered in Har­ry’s ear.

“Ha­grid,” said Har­ry loud­ly, “give it two weeks and Nor­bert’s go­ing to be as long as your house. Mal­foy could go to Dum­ble­dore at any mo­ment.”

Ha­grid bit his lip.

“I — I know I can’t keep him for­ev­er, but I can’t jus’ dump him, I can’t.”

Har­ry sud­den­ly turned to Ron. “Char­lie.” he said.

“You’re los­ing it, too,” said Ron. “I’m Ron, re­mem­ber?”

“No — Char­lie — your broth­er, Char­lie. In Ro­ma­nia. Study­ing drag­ons. We could send Nor­bert to him. Char­lie can take care of him and then put him back in the wild!”

“Bril­liant!” said Ron. “How about it, Ha­grid?”

And in the end, Ha­grid agreed that they could send an owl to Char­lie to ask him.



The fol­low­ing week dragged by. Wednes­day night found Hermione and Har­ry sit­ting alone in the com­mon room, long af­ter ev­ery­one else had gone to bed. The clock on the wall had just chimed mid­night when the por­trait hole burst open. Ron ap­peared out of nowhere as he pulled off Har­ry’s in­vis­ibil­ity cloak. He had been down at Ha­grid’s hut, help­ing him feed Nor­bert, who was now eat­ing dead rats by the crate.

“It bit me!” he said, show­ing them his hand, which was wrapped in a bloody hand­ker­chief. “I’m not go­ing to be able to hold a quill for a week. I tell you, that drag­on’s the most hor­ri­ble an­imal I’ve ev­er met, but the way Ha­grid goes on about it, you’d think it was a fluffy lit­tle bun­ny rab­bit. When it bit me he told me off for fright­en­ing it. And when I left, he was singing it a lul­la­by.”

There was a tap on the dark win­dow.

“It’s Hed­wig!” said Har­ry, hur­ry­ing to let her in. “She’ll have Char­lie’s an­swer!”

The three of them put their heads to­geth­er to read the note.



Dear Ron,



How are you? Thanks for the let­ter — I’d be glad to take the Nor­we­gian Ridge­back, but it won’t be easy get­ting him here. I think the best thing will be to send him over with some friends of mine who are com­ing to vis­it me next week. Trou­ble is, they mustn’t be seen car­ry­ing an il­le­gal drag­on.

Could you get the Ridge­back up the tallest tow­er at mid­night on Sat­ur­day? They can meet you there and take him away while it’s still dark.

Send me an an­swer as soon as pos­si­ble.



Love,

Char­lie



They looked at one an­oth­er.

“We’ve got the in­vis­ibil­ity cloak,” said Har­ry. “It shouldn’t be too dif­fi­cult – I think the cloaks big enough to cov­er two of us and Nor­bert.”

It was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the oth­er two agreed with him. Any­thing to get rid of Nor­bert — and Mal­foy.



There was a hitch. By the next morn­ing, Ron’s bit­ten hand had swollen to twice its usu­al size. He didn’t know whether it was safe to go to Madam Pom­frey — would she rec­og­nize a drag­on bite? By the af­ter­noon, though, he had no choice. The cut had turned a nasty shade of green. It looked as if Nor­bert’s fangs were poi­sonous.

Har­ry and Hermione rushed up to the hos­pi­tal wing at the end of the day to find Ron in a ter­ri­ble state in bed.

“It’s not just my hand,” he whis­pered, “al­though that feels like it’s about to fall off. Mal­foy told Madam Pom­frey he want­ed to bor­row one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me. He kept threat­en­ing to tell her what re­al­ly bit me — I’ve told her it was a dog, but I don’t think she be­lieves me — I shouldn’t have hit him at the Quid­ditch match, that’s why he’s do­ing this.”

Har­ry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down.

“It’ll all be over at mid­night on Sat­ur­day,” said Hermione, but this didn’t soothe Ron at all. On the con­trary, he sat bolt up­right and broke in­to a sweat.

“Mid­night on Sat­ur­day!” he said in a hoarse voice. “Oh no oh no — I’ve just re­mem­bered — Char­lie’s let­ter was in that book Mal­foy took, he’s go­ing to know we’re get­ting rid of Nor­bert.”

Har­ry and Hermione didn’t get a chance to an­swer. Madam Pom­frey came over at that mo­ment and made them leave, say­ing Ron need­ed sleep.



“It’s too late to change the plan now,” Har­ry told Hermione. “We haven’t got time to send Char­lie an­oth­er owl, and this could be our on­ly chance to get rid of Nor­bert. We’ll have to risk it. And we have got the in­vis­ibil­ity cloak, Mal­foy doesn’t know about that.”

They found Fang, the boarhound, sit­ting out­side with a ban­daged tail when they went to tell Ha­grid, who opened a win­dow to talk to them.

“I won’t let you in,” he puffed. “Nor­bert’s at a tricky stage — noth­in’ I can’t han­dle.”

When they told him about Char­lie’s let­ter, his eyes filled with tears, al­though that might have been be­cause Nor­bert had just bit­ten him on the leg.

“Aargh! It’s all right, he on­ly got my boot — jus’ playin’ — he’s on­ly a ba­by, af­ter all.”

The ba­by banged its tail on the wall, mak­ing the win­dows rat­tle. Har­ry and Hermione walked back to the cas­tle feel­ing Sat­ur­day couldn’t come quick­ly enough.



They would have felt sor­ry for Ha­grid when the time came for him to say good-​bye to Nor­bert if they hadn’t been so wor­ried about what they had to do. It was a very dark, cloudy night, and they were a bit late ar­riv­ing at Ha­grid’s hut be­cause they’d had to wait for Peeves to get out of their way in the en­trance hall, where he’d been play­ing ten­nis against the wall. Ha­grid had Nor­bert packed and ready in a large crate.

“He’s got lots o’ rats an’ some brandy fer the jour­ney,” said Ha­grid in a muf­fled voice. “An’ I’ve packed his ted­dy bear in case he gets lone­ly.”

From in­side the crate came rip­ping nois­es that sound­ed to Har­ry as though the ted­dy was hav­ing his head torn off.

“Bye-​bye, Nor­bert!” Ha­grid sobbed, as Har­ry and Hermione cov­ered the crate with the in­vis­ibil­ity cloak and stepped un­der­neath it them­selves. “Mom­my will nev­er for­get you!”

How they man­aged to get the crate back up to the cas­tle, they nev­er knew. Mid­night ticked near­er as they heaved Nor­bert up the mar­ble stair­case in the en­trance hall and along the dark cor­ri­dors. UP an­oth­er stair­case, then an­oth­er – even one of Har­ry’s short­cuts didn’t make the work much eas­ier.

“Near­ly there!” Har­ry pant­ed as they reached the cor­ri­dor be­neath the tallest tow­er.

Then a sud­den move­ment ahead of them made them al­most drop the crate. For­get­ting that they were al­ready in­vis­ible, they shrank in­to the shad­ows, star­ing at the dark out­lines of two peo­ple grap­pling with each oth­er ten feet away. A lamp flared.

Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall, in a tar­tan bathrobe and a hair net, had Mal­foy by the ear.

“De­ten­tion!” she shout­ed. “And twen­ty points from Slytherin! Wan­der­ing around in the mid­dle of the night, how dare you —”

“You don’t un­der­stand, Pro­fes­sor. Har­ry Pot­ter’s com­ing — he’s got a drag­on!”

“What ut­ter rub­bish! How dare you tell such lies! Come on — I shall see Pro­fes­sor Snape about you, Mal­foy!”

The steep spi­ral stair­case up to the top of the tow­er seemed the eas­iest thing in the world af­ter that. Not un­til they’d stepped out in­to the cold night air did they throw off the cloak, glad to be able to breathe prop­er­ly again. Hermione did a sort of jig.

“Mal­foy’s got de­ten­tion! I could sing!”

“Don’t,” Har­ry ad­vised her.

Chuck­ling about Mal­foy, they wait­ed, Nor­bert thrash­ing about in his crate. About ten min­utes lat­er, four broom­sticks came swoop­ing down out of the dark­ness.

Char­lie’s friends were a cheery lot. They showed Har­ry and Hermione the har­ness they’d rigged up, so they could sus­pend Nor­bert be­tween them. They all helped buck­le Nor­bert safe­ly in­to it and then Har­ry and Hermione shook hands with the oth­ers and thanked them very much.

At last, Nor­bert was go­ing…go­ing…gone.

They slipped back down the spi­ral stair­case, their hearts as light as their hands, now that Nor­bert was off them. No more drag­on — Mal­foy in de­ten­tion — what could spoil their hap­pi­ness?

The an­swer to that was wait­ing at the foot of the stairs. As they stepped in­to the cor­ri­dor, Filch’s face loomed sud­den­ly out of the dark­ness.

“Well, well, well,” he whis­pered, “we are in trou­ble.”

They’d left the in­vis­ibil­ity cloak on top of the tow­er.





HP 1 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone





CHAPTER FIFTEEN




THE FOR­BID­DEN FOR­EST



T hings couldn’t have been worse.

Filch took them down to Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall’s study on the first floor, where they sat and wait­ed with­out say­ing a word to each oth­er. Hermione was trem­bling. Ex­cus­es, al­ibis, and wild cov­er- up sto­ries chased each oth­er around Har­ry’s brain, each more fee­ble than the last. He couldn’t see how they were go­ing to get out of trou­ble this time. They were cor­nered. How could they have been so stupid as to for­get the cloak? There was no rea­son on earth that Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall would ac­cept for their be­ing out of bed and creep­ing around the school in the dead of night, let alone be­ing up the tallest as­tron­omy tow­er, which was out-​of-​bounds ex­cept for class­es. Add Nor­bert and the in­vis­ibil­ity cloak, and they might as well be pack­ing their bags al­ready.

Had Har­ry thought that things couldn’t have been worse? He was wrong. When Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall ap­peared, she was lead­ing Neville.

“Har­ry!” Neville burst out, the mo­ment he saw the oth­er two. “I was try­ing to find you to warn you, I heard Mal­foy say­ing he was go­ing to catch you, he said you had a drag—”

Har­ry shook his head vi­olent­ly to shut Neville up, but Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall had seen. She looked more like­ly to breathe fire than Nor­bert as she tow­ered over the three of them.

“I would nev­er have be­lieved it of any of you. Mr. Filch says you were up in the as­tron­omy tow­er. It’s one o’clock in the morn­ing. Ex­plain your­selves.”

It was the first time Hermione had ev­er failed to an­swer a teach­er’s ques­tion. She was star­ing at her slip­pers, as still as a stat­ue.

“I think I’ve got a good idea of what’s been go­ing on,” said Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall. “It doesn’t take a ge­nius to work it out. You fed Dra­co Mal­foy some cock-​and-​bull sto­ry about a drag­on, try­ing to get him out of bed and in­to trou­ble. I’ve al­ready caught him. I sup­pose you think it’s fun­ny that Long­bot­tom here heard the sto­ry and be­lieved it, too?”

Har­ry caught Neville’s eye and tried to tell him with­out words that this wasn’t true, be­cause Neville was look­ing stunned and hurt. Poor, blun­der­ing Neville — Har­ry knew what it must have cost him to try and find them in the dark, to warn them.

“I’m dis­gust­ed,” said Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall. “Four stu­dents out of bed in one night! I’ve nev­er heard of such a thing be­fore! You, Miss Granger, I thought you had more sense. As for you, Mr. Pot­ter, I thought Gryffind­or meant more to you than this. All three of you will re­ceive de­ten­tions — yes, you too, Mr. Long­bot­tom, noth­ing gives you the right to walk around school at night, es­pe­cial­ly these days, it’s very dan­ger­ous — and fifty points will be tak­en from Gryffind­or.”

“Fifty?” Har­ry gasped — they would lose the lead, the lead he’d won in the last Quid­ditch match.

“Fifty points each,” said Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall, breath­ing heav­ily through her long, point­ed nose.

“Pro­fes­sor — please —”

“You can’t —”

“Don’t tell me what I can and can’t do, Pot­ter. Now get back to bed, all of you. I’ve nev­er been more ashamed of Gryffind­or stu­dents.”

A hun­dred and fifty points lost. That put Gryffind­or in last place. In one night, they’d ru­ined any chance Gryffind­or had had for the house cup. Har­ry felt as though the bot­tom had dropped out of his stom­ach. How could they ev­er make up for this?

Har­ry didn’t sleep all night. He could hear Neville sob­bing in­to his pil­low for what seemed like hours. Har­ry couldn’t think of any­thing to say to com­fort him. He knew Neville, like him­self, was dread­ing the dawn. What would hap­pen when the rest of Gryffind­or found out what they’d done?



At first, Gryffind­ors pass­ing the gi­ant hour­glass­es that record­ed the house points the next day thought there’d been a mis­take. How could they sud­den­ly have a hun­dred and fifty points few­er than yes­ter­day? And then the sto­ry start­ed to spread: Har­ry Pot­ter, the fa­mous Har­ry Pot­ter, their hero of two Quid­ditch match­es, had lost them all those points, him and a cou­ple of oth­er stupid first years.

From be­ing one of the most pop­ular and ad­mired peo­ple at the school, Har­ry was sud­den­ly the most hat­ed. Even Raven­claws and Huf­flepuffs turned on him, be­cause ev­ery­one had been long­ing to see Slytherin lose the house cup. Ev­ery­where Har­ry went, peo­ple point­ed and didn’t trou­ble to low­er their voic­es as they in­sult­ed him. Slytherins, on the oth­er hand, clapped as he walked past them, whistling and cheer­ing, “Thanks Pot­ter, we owe you one!”

On­ly Ron stood by him.

“They’ll all for­get this in a few weeks. Fred and George have lost loads of points in all the time they’ve been here, and peo­ple still like them.”

“They’ve nev­er lost a hun­dred and fifty points in one go, though, have they?” said Har­ry mis­er­ably.

“Well — no,” Ron ad­mit­ted.

It was a bit late to re­pair the dam­age, but Har­ry swore to him­self not to med­dle in things that weren’t his busi­ness from now on. He’d had it with sneak­ing around and spy­ing. He felt so ashamed of him­self that he went to Wood and of­fered to re­sign from the Quid­ditch team.

“Re­sign?” Wood thun­dered. “What good’ll that do? How are we go­ing to get any points back if we can’t win at Quid­ditch?”

But even Quid­ditch had lost its fun. The rest of the team wouldn’t speak to Har­ry dur­ing prac­tice, and if they had to speak about him, they called him “the Seek­er.”

Hermione and Neville were suf­fer­ing, too. They didn’t have as bad a time as Har­ry, be­cause they weren’t as well-​known, but no­body would speak to them, ei­ther. Hermione had stopped draw­ing at­ten­tion to her­self in class, keep­ing her head down and work­ing in si­lence.

Har­ry was al­most glad that the ex­ams weren’t far away. All the study­ing he had to do kept his mind off his mis­ery. He, Ron, and Hermione kept to them­selves, work­ing late in­to the night, try­ing to re­mem­ber the in­gre­di­ents in com­pli­cat­ed po­tions, learn charms and spells by heart, mem­orize the dates of mag­ical dis­cov­er­ies and gob­lin re­bel­lions....

Then, about a week be­fore the ex­ams were due to start, Har­ry’s new res­olu­tion not to in­ter­fere in any­thing that didn’t con­cern him was put to an un­ex­pect­ed test. Walk­ing back from the li­brary on his own one af­ter­noon, he heard some­body whim­per­ing from a class­room up ahead. As he drew clos­er, he heard Quir­rell’s voice.

“No — no — not again, please —”

It sound­ed as though some­one was threat­en­ing him. Har­ry moved clos­er.

“All right — all right —” he heard Quir­rell sob.

Next sec­ond, Quir­rell came hur­ry­ing out of the class­room straight­en­ing his tur­ban. He was pale and looked as though he was about to cry. He strode out of sight; Har­ry didn’t think Quir­rell had even no­ticed him. He wait­ed un­til Quir­rell’s foot­steps had dis­ap­peared, then peered in­to the class­room. It was emp­ty, but a door stood ajar at the oth­er end. Har­ry was halfway to­ward it be­fore he re­mem­bered what he’d promised him­self about not med­dling.

All the same, he’d have gam­bled twelve Sor­cer­er’s Stones that Snape had just left the room, and from what Har­ry had just heard, Snape would be walk­ing with a new spring in his step — Quir­rell seemed to have giv­en in at last.

Har­ry went back to the li­brary, where Hermione was test­ing Ron on As­tron­omy. Har­ry told them what he’d heard.

“Snape’s done it, then!” said Ron. “If Quir­rell’s told him how to break his An­ti-​Dark Force spell —”

“There’s still Fluffy, though,” said Hermione.

“Maybe Snape’s found out how to get past him with­out ask­ing Ha­grid,” said Ron, look­ing up at the thou­sands of books sur­round­ing them. “I bet there’s a book some­where in here telling you how to get past a gi­ant three-​head­ed dog. So what do we do, Har­ry?”

The light of ad­ven­ture was kin­dling again in Ron’s eyes, but Hermione an­swered be­fore Har­ry could.

“Go to Dum­ble­dore. That’s what we should have done ages ago. If we try any­thing our­selves we’ll be thrown out for sure.”

“But we’ve got no proof!” said Har­ry. “Quir­rell’s too scared to back us up. Snape’s on­ly got to say he doesn’t know how the troll got in at Hal­loween and that he was nowhere near the third floor — who do you think they’ll be­lieve, him or us? It’s not ex­act­ly a se­cret we hate him, Dum­ble­dore’ll think we made it up to get him sacked. Filch wouldn’t help us if his life de­pend­ed on it, he’s too friend­ly with Snape, and the more stu­dents get thrown out, the bet­ter, he’ll think. And don’t for­get, we’re not sup­posed to know about the Stone or Fluffy. That’ll take a lot of ex­plain­ing.”

Hermione looked con­vinced, but Ron didn’t.

“If we just do a bit of pok­ing around —”

“No,” said Har­ry flat­ly, “we’ve done enough pok­ing around.”

He pulled a map of Jupiter to­ward him and start­ed to learn the names of its moons.



The fol­low­ing morn­ing, notes were de­liv­ered to Har­ry, Hermione, and Neville at the break­fast ta­ble. They were all the same:

Your de­ten­tion will take place at eleven o’clock tonight.

Meet Mr. Filch in the en­trance hall.



Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall



Har­ry had for­got­ten they still had de­ten­tions to do in the furor over the points they’d lost. He half ex­pect­ed Hermione to com­plain that this was a whole night of study­ing lost, but she didn’t say a word. Like Har­ry, she felt they de­served what they’d got.

At eleven o’clock that night, they said good-​bye to Ron in the com­mon room and went down to the en­trance hall with Neville. Filch was al­ready there — and so was Mal­foy. Har­ry had al­so for­got­ten that Mal­foy had got­ten a de­ten­tion, too.

“Fol­low me,” said Filch, light­ing a lamp and lead­ing them out­side.

“I bet you’ll think twice about break­ing a school rule again, won’t you, eh?” he said, leer­ing at them. “Oh yes…hard work and pain are the best teach­ers if you ask me….It’s just a pity they let the old pun­ish­ments die out…hang you by your wrists from the ceil­ing for a few days, I’ve got the chains still in my of­fice, keep ‘em well oiled in case they’re ev­er need­ed…Right, off we go, and don’t think of run­ning off, now, it’ll be worse for you if you do.”

They marched off across the dark grounds. Neville kept sniff­ing. Har­ry won­dered what their pun­ish­ment was go­ing to be. It must be some­thing re­al­ly hor­ri­ble, or Filch wouldn’t be sound­ing so de­light­ed.

The moon was bright, but clouds scud­ding across it kept throw­ing them in­to dark­ness. Ahead, Har­ry could see the light­ed win­dows of Ha­grid’s hut. Then they heard a dis­tant shout.

“Is that you, Filch? Hur­ry up, I want ter get start­ed.”

Har­ry’s heart rose; if they were go­ing to be work­ing with Ha­grid it wouldn’t be so bad. His re­lief must have showed in his face, be­cause Filch said, “I sup­pose you think you’ll be en­joy­ing your­self with that oaf? Well, think again, boy — it’s in­to the for­est you’re go­ing and I’m much mis­tak­en if you’ll all come out in one piece.”

At this, Neville let out a lit­tle moan, and Mal­foy stopped dead in his tracks.

“The for­est?” he re­peat­ed, and he didn’t sound quite as cool as usu­al. “We can’t go in there at night — there’s all sorts of things in there — were­wolves, I heard.”

Neville clutched the sleeve of Har­ry’s robe and made a chok­ing noise.

“That’s your prob­lem, isn’t it?” said Filch, his voice crack­ing with glee. “Should’ve thought of them were­wolves be­fore you got in trou­ble, shouldn’t you?”

Ha­grid came strid­ing to­ward them out of the dark, Fang at his heel. He was car­ry­ing his large cross­bow, and a quiver of ar­rows hung over his shoul­der.

“Abou’ time,” he said. “I bin wait­in’ fer half an hour al­ready. All right, Har­ry, Hermione?”

“I shouldn’t be too friend­ly to them, Ha­grid,” said Filch cold­ly, they’re here to be pun­ished, af­ter all.”

“That’s why yer late, is it?” said Ha­grid, frown­ing at Filch. “Bin lec­turin’ them, eh? ‘Snot your place ter do that. Yeh’ve done yer bit, I’ll take over from here.”

“I’ll be back at dawn,” said Filch, “for what’s left of them,” he added nas­ti­ly, and he turned and start­ed back to­ward the cas­tle, his lamp bob­bing away in the dark­ness.

Mal­foy now turned to Ha­grid.

“I’m not go­ing in that for­est,” he said, and Har­ry was pleased to hear the note of pan­ic in his voice.

“Yeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hog­warts,” said Ha­grid fierce­ly. “Yeh’ve done wrong an’ now yeh’ve got ter pay fer it.”

“But this is ser­vant stuff, it’s not for stu­dents to do. I thought we’d be copy­ing lines or some­thing, if my fa­ther knew I was do­ing this, he’d—”

“—tell yer that’s how it is at Hog­warts,” Ha­grid growled. “Copy­in’ lines! What good’s that ter any­one? Yeh’ll do sum­mat use­ful or yeh’ll get out. If yeh think yer fa­ther’d rather you were ex­pelled, then get back off ter the cas­tle an’ pack. Go on.”

Mal­foy didn’t move. He looked at Ha­grid fu­ri­ous­ly, but then dropped his gaze.

“Right then,” said Ha­grid, “now, lis­ten care­ful­ly, ‘cause it’s dan­ger­ous what we’re gonna do tonight, an’ I don’ want no one takin’ risks. Fol­low me over here a mo­ment.”

He led them to the very edge of the for­est. Hold­ing his lamp up high, he point­ed down a nar­row, wind­ing earth track that dis­ap­peared in­to the thick black trees. A light breeze lift­ed their hair as they looked in­to the for­est.

“Look there,” said Ha­grid, “see that stuff shinin’ on the ground? Sil­very stuff? That’s uni­corn blood. There’s a uni­corn in there bin hurt bad­ly by sum­mat. This is the sec­ond time in a week. I found one dead last Wednes­day. We’re gonna try an’ find the poor thing. We might have ter put it out of its mis­ery.”

“And what if what­ev­er hurt the uni­corn finds us first?” said Mal­foy, un­able to keep the fear out of his voice.

“There’s noth­in’ that lives in the for­est that’ll hurt yeh if yer with me or Fang,” said Ha­grid. “An’ keep ter the path. Right, now, we’re gonna split in­ter two par­ties an’ fol­low the trail in diff’rent di­rec­tions. There’s blood all over the place, it must’ve bin stag­gerin’ around since last night at least.”

“I want Fang,” said Mal­foy quick­ly, look­ing at Fang’s long teeth.

“All right, but I warn yeh, he’s a cow­ard,” said Ha­grid. “So me, Har­ry, an’ Hermione’ll go one way an’ Dra­co, Neville, an’ Fang’ll go the oth­er. Now, if any of us finds the uni­corn, we’ll send up green sparks, right? Get yer wands out an’ prac­tice now — that’s it — an’ if any­one gets in trou­ble, send up red sparks, an’ we’ll all come an’ find yeh — so, be care­ful — let’s go.”

The for­est was black and silent. A lit­tle way in­to it they reached a fork in the earth path, and Har­ry, Hermione, and Ha­grid took the left path while Mal­foy, Neville, and Fang took the right.

They walked in si­lence, their eyes on the ground. Ev­ery now and then a ray of moon­light through the branch­es above lit a spot of sil­ver-​blue blood on the fall­en leaves.

Har­ry saw that Ha­grid looked very wor­ried.

“Could a were­wolf be killing the uni­corns?” Har­ry asked.

“Not fast enough,” said Ha­grid. “It’s not easy ter catch a uni­corn, they’re pow­er­ful mag­ic crea­tures. I nev­er knew one ter be hurt be­fore.”

They walked past a mossy tree stump. Har­ry could hear run­ning wa­ter; there must be a stream some­where close by. There were still spots of uni­corn blood here and there along the wind­ing path.

“You all right, Hermione?” Ha­grid whis­pered. “Don’ wor­ry, it can’t’ve gone far if it’s this bad­ly hurt, an’ then we’ll be able ter — GET BE­HIND THAT TREE!”

Ha­grid seized Har­ry and Hermione and hoist­ed them off the path be­hind a tow­er­ing oak. He pulled out an ar­row and fit­ted it in­to his cross­bow, rais­ing it, ready to fire. The three of them lis­tened. Some­thing was slith­er­ing over dead leaves near­by: it sound­ed like a cloak trail­ing along the ground. Ha­grid was squint­ing up the dark path, but af­ter a few sec­onds, the sound fad­ed away.

“I knew it,” he mur­mured. “There’s sum­mat in here that shouldn’ be.”

“A were­wolf?” Har­ry sug­gest­ed.

“That wasn’ no were­wolf an’ it wasn’ no uni­corn, nei­ther,” said Ha­grid grim­ly. “Right, fol­low me, but care­ful, now.”

They walked more slow­ly, ears strain­ing for the faintest sound. Sud­den­ly, in a clear­ing ahead, some­thing def­inite­ly moved.

“Who’s there?” Ha­grid called. “Show yer­self — I’m armed!”

And in­to the clear­ing came — was it a man, or a horse? To the waist, a man, with red hair and beard, but be­low that was a horse’s gleam­ing chest­nut body with a long, red­dish tail. Har­ry and Hermione’s jaws dropped.

“Oh, it’s you, Ro­nan,” said Ha­grid in re­lief. “How are yeh?”

He walked for­ward and shook the cen­taur’s hand.

“Good evening to you, Ha­grid,” said Ro­nan. He had a deep, sor­row­ful voice. “Were you go­ing to shoot me?”

“Can’t be too care­ful, Ro­nan,” said Ha­grid, pat­ting his cross­bow. “There’s sum­mat bad loose in this for­est. This is Har­ry Pot­ter an’ Hermione Granger, by the way. Stu­dents up at the school. An’ this is Ro­nan, you two. He’s a cen­taur.

“We’d no­ticed,” said Hermione faint­ly.

“Good evening,” said Ro­nan. “Stu­dents, are you? And do you learn much, up at the school?”

“Erm —”

“A bit,” said Hermione timid­ly.

“A bit. Well, that’s some­thing.” Ro­nan sighed. He flung back his head and stared at the sky. “Mars is bright tonight.”

“Yeah,” said Ha­grid, glanc­ing up, too. “Lis­ten, I’m glad we’ve run in­ter yeh, Ro­nan, ‘cause there’s a uni­corn bin hurt — you seen any­thin’?”

Ro­nan didn’t an­swer im­me­di­ate­ly. He stared un­blink­ing­ly up­ward, then sighed again.

“Al­ways the in­no­cent are the first vic­tims,” he said. “So it has been for ages past, so it is now.”

“Yeah,” said Ha­grid, “but have yeh seen any­thin’ Ro­nan? Any­thin’ un­usu­al?”

“Mars is bright tonight,” Ro­nan re­peat­ed, while Ha­grid watched him im­pa­tient­ly. “Un­usu­al­ly bright.”

“Yeah, but I was meanin’ any­thin’ un­usu­al a bit near­er home, said Ha­grid. “So yeh haven’t no­ticed any­thin’ strange?”

Yet again, Ro­nan took a while to an­swer. At last, he said, “The for­est hides many se­crets.”

A move­ment in the trees be­hind Ro­nan made Ha­grid raise his bow again, but it was on­ly a sec­ond cen­taur, black-​haired and -bod­ied and wilder-​look­ing than Ro­nan.

“Hul­lo, Bane,” said Ha­grid. “All right?”

“Good evening, Ha­grid, I hope you are well?”

“Well enough. Look, I’ve jus’ bin askin’ Ro­nan, you seen any­thin’ odd in here late­ly? There’s a uni­corn bin in­jured — would yeh know any­thin’ about it?”

Bane walked over to stand next to Ro­nan. He looked sky­ward. “Mars is bright tonight,” he said sim­ply.

“We’ve heard,” said Ha­grid grumpi­ly. “Well, if ei­ther of you do see any­thin’, let me know, won’t yeh? We’ll be off, then.”

Har­ry and Hermione fol­lowed him out of the clear­ing, star­ing over their shoul­ders at Ro­nan and Bane un­til the trees blocked their view.

“Nev­er,” said Ha­grid ir­ri­ta­bly, “try an’ get a straight an­swer out of a cen­taur. Rud­dy stargaz­ers. Not in­ter­est­ed in any­thin’ clos­er’n the moon.”

“Are there many of them in here?” asked Hermione.

“Oh, a fair few….Keep them­selves to them­selves most­ly, but they’re good enough about turnin’ up if ev­er I want a word. They’re deep, mind, cen­taurs…they know things…jus’ don’ let on much.”

“D’you think that was a cen­taur we heard ear­li­er?” said Har­ry.

“Did that sound like hooves to you? Nah, if yeh ask me, that was what’s bin killin’ the uni­corns – nev­er heard any­thin’ like it be­fore.”

They walked on through the dense, dark trees. Har­ry kept look­ing ner­vous­ly over his shoul­der. He had the nasty feel­ing they were be­ing watched. He was very glad they had Ha­grid and his cross­bow with them. They had just passed a bend in the path when Hermione grabbed Ha­grid’s arm.

“Ha­grid! Look! Red sparks, the oth­ers are in trou­ble!”

“You two wait here!” Ha­grid shout­ed. “Stay on the path, I’ll come back for yeh!”

They heard him crash­ing away through the un­der­growth and stood look­ing at each oth­er, very scared, un­til they couldn’t hear any­thing but the rustling of leaves around them.

“You don’t think they’ve been hurt, do you?” whis­pered Hermione.

“I don’t care if Mal­foy has, but if some­thing’s got Neville…it’s our fault he’s here in the first place.”

The min­utes dragged by. Their ears seemed sharp­er than usu­al. Har­ry’s seemed to be pick­ing up ev­ery sigh of the wind, ev­ery crack­ing twig. What was go­ing on? Where were the oth­ers?

At last, a great crunch­ing noise an­nounced Ha­grid’s re­turn. Mal­foy, Neville, and Fang were with him. Ha­grid was fum­ing. Mal­foy, it seemed, had sneaked up be­hind Neville and grabbed him as a joke. Neville had pan­icked and sent up the sparks.

“We’ll be lucky ter catch any­thin’ now, with the rack­et you two were makin’. Right, we’re changin’ groups — Neville, you stay with me an’ Hermione, Har­ry, you go with Fang an’ this id­iot. I’m sor­ry,” Ha­grid added in a whis­per to Har­ry, “but he’ll have a hard­er time fright­enin’ you, an’ we’ve got­ta get this done.”

So Har­ry set off in­to the heart of the for­est with Mal­foy and Fang. They walked for near­ly half an hour, deep­er and deep­er in­to the for­est, un­til the path be­came al­most im­pos­si­ble to fol­low be­cause the trees were so thick. Har­ry thought the blood seemed to be get­ting thick­er. There were splash­es on the roots of a tree, as though the poor crea­ture had been thrash­ing around in pain close by. Har­ry could see a clear­ing ahead, through the tan­gled branch­es of an an­cient oak.

“Look —” he mur­mured, hold­ing out his arm to stop Mal­foy.

Some­thing bright white was gleam­ing on the ground. They inched clos­er.

It was the uni­corn all right, and it was dead. Har­ry had nev­er seen any­thing so beau­ti­ful and sad. Its long, slen­der legs were stuck out at odd an­gles where it had fall­en and its mane was spread pearly-​white on the dark leaves.

Har­ry had tak­en one step to­ward it when a slith­er­ing sound made him freeze where he stood. A bush on the edge of the clear­ing quiv­ered.…Then, out of the shad­ows, a hood­ed fig­ure came crawl­ing across the ground like some stalk­ing beast. Har­ry, Mal­foy, and Fang stood trans­fixed. The cloaked fig­ure reached the uni­corn, low­ered its head over the wound in the an­imal’s side, and be­gan to drink its blood.

“AAAAAAAAAARGH!”

Mal­foy let out a ter­ri­ble scream and bolt­ed — so did Fang. The hood­ed fig­ure raised its head and looked right at Har­ry — uni­corn blood was drib­bling down its front. It got to its feet and came swift­ly to­ward Har­ry — he couldn’t move for fear.

Then a pain like he’d nev­er felt be­fore pierced his head; it was as though his scar were on fire. Half blind­ed, he stag­gered back­ward. He heard hooves be­hind him, gal­lop­ing, and some­thing jumped clean over Har­ry, charg­ing at the fig­ure.

The pain in Har­ry’s head was so bad he fell to his knees. It took a minute or two to pass. When he looked up, the fig­ure had gone. A cen­taur was stand­ing over him, not Ro­nan or Bane; this one looked younger; he had white-​blond hair and a palomi­no body.

“Are you all right?” said the cen­taur, pulling Har­ry to his feet.

“Yes — thank you — what was that?”

The cen­taur didn’t an­swer. He had as­ton­ish­ing­ly blue eyes, like pale sap­phires. He looked care­ful­ly at Har­ry, his eyes lin­ger­ing on the scar that stood out, livid, on Har­ry’s fore­head.

“You are the Pot­ter boy,” he said. “You had bet­ter get back to Ha­grid. The for­est is not safe at this time — es­pe­cial­ly for you. Can you ride? It will be quick­er this way.

“My name is Firen­ze,” he added, as he low­ered him­self on to his front legs so that Har­ry could clam­ber on­to his back.

There was sud­den­ly a sound of more gal­lop­ing from the oth­er side of the clear­ing. Ro­nan and Bane came burst­ing through the trees, their flanks heav­ing and sweaty.

“Firen­ze!” Bane thun­dered. “What are you do­ing? You have a hu­man on your back! Have you no shame? Are you a com­mon mule?”

“Do you re­al­ize who this is?” said Firen­ze. “This is the Pot­ter boy. The quick­er he leaves this for­est, the bet­ter.”

“What have you been telling him?” growled Bane. “Re­mem­ber, Firen­ze, we are sworn not to set our­selves against the heav­ens. Have we not read what is to come in the move­ments of the plan­ets?”

Ro­nan pawed the ground ner­vous­ly. “I’m sure Firen­ze thought he was act­ing for the best, “ he said in his gloomy voice.

Bane kicked his back legs in anger.

“For the best! What is that to do with us? Cen­taurs are con­cerned with what has been fore­told! It is not our busi­ness to run around like don­keys af­ter stray hu­mans in our for­est!”

Firen­ze sud­den­ly reared on to his hind legs in anger, so that Har­ry had to grab his shoul­ders to stay on.

“Do you not see that uni­corn?” Firen­ze bel­lowed at Bane. “Do you not un­der­stand why it was killed? Or have the plan­ets not let you in on that se­cret? I set my­self against what is lurk­ing in this for­est, Bane, yes, with hu­mans along­side me if I must.”

And Firen­ze whisked around; with Har­ry clutch­ing on as best he could, they plunged off in­to the trees, leav­ing Ro­nan and Bane be­hind them.

Har­ry didn’t have a clue what was go­ing on.

“Why’s Bane so an­gry?” he asked. “What was that thing you saved me from, any­way?”

Firen­ze slowed to a walk, warned Har­ry to keep his head bowed in case of low-​hang­ing branch­es, but did not an­swer Har­ry’s ques­tion. They made their way through the trees in si­lence for so long that Har­ry thought Firen­ze didn’t want to talk to him any­more. They were pass­ing through a par­tic­ular­ly dense patch of trees, how­ev­er, when Firen­ze sud­den­ly stopped.

“Har­ry Pot­ter, do you know what uni­corn blood is used for?”

“No,” said Har­ry, star­tled by the odd ques­tion. “We’ve on­ly used the horn and tail hair in Po­tions.”

“That is be­cause it is a mon­strous thing, to slay a uni­corn,” said Firen­ze. “On­ly one who has noth­ing to lose, and ev­ery­thing to gain, would com­mit such a crime. The blood of a uni­corn will keep you alive, even if you are an inch from death, but at a ter­ri­ble price. You have slain some­thing pure and de­fense­less to save your­self, and you will have but a half-​life, a cursed life, from the mo­ment the blood touch­es your lips.”

Har­ry stared at the back of Firen­ze’s head, which was dap­pled sil­ver in the moon­light.

“But who’d be that des­per­ate?” he won­dered aloud. “If you’re go­ing to be cursed for­ev­er, death’s bet­ter, isn’t it?”

“It is,” Firen­ze agreed, “un­less all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink some­thing else — some­thing that will bring you back to full strength and pow­er — some­thing that will mean you can nev­er die. Mr. Pot­ter, do you know what is hid­den in the school at this very mo­ment?”

“The Sor­cer­er’s Stone! Of course — the Elixir of Life! But I don’t un­der­stand who —”

“Can you think of no­body who has wait­ed many years to re­turn to pow­er, who has clung to life, await­ing their chance?”

It was as though an iron fist had clenched sud­den­ly around Har­ry’s heart. Over the rustling of the trees, he seemed to hear once more what Ha­grid had told him on the night they had met: “Some say he died. Codswal­lop, in my opin­ion. Dun­no if he had enough hu­man left in him to die.”

“Do you mean,” Har­ry croaked, “that was Vol-”

“Har­ry! Har­ry, are you all right?”

Hermione was run­ning to­ward them down the path, Ha­grid puff­ing along be­hind her.

“I’m fine,” said Har­ry, hard­ly know­ing what he was say­ing. “The uni­corn’s dead, Ha­grid, it’s in that clear­ing back there.”

“This is where I leave you,” Firen­ze mur­mured as Ha­grid hur­ried off to ex­am­ine the uni­corn. “You are safe now.”

Har­ry slid off his back.

“Good luck, Har­ry Pot­ter,” said Firen­ze. “The plan­ets have been read wrong­ly be­fore now, even by cen­taurs. I hope this is one of those times.”

He turned and can­tered back in­to the depths of the for­est, leav­ing Har­ry shiv­er­ing be­hind him.



Ron had fall­en asleep in the dark com­mon room, wait­ing for them to re­turn. He shout­ed some­thing about Quid­ditch fouls when Har­ry rough­ly shook him awake. In a mat­ter of sec­onds, though, he was wide-​eyed as Har­ry be­gan to tell him and Hermione what had hap­pened in the for­est.

Har­ry couldn’t sit down. He paced up and down in front of the fire. He was still shak­ing.

“Snape wants the stone for Volde­mort…and Volde­mort’s wait­ing in the for­est…and all this time we thought Snape just want­ed to get rich….”

“Stop say­ing the name!” said Ron in a ter­ri­fied whis­per, as if he thought Volde­mort could hear them.

Har­ry wasn’t lis­ten­ing.

“Firen­ze saved me, but he shouldn’t have done so.…Bane was fu­ri­ous…he was talk­ing about in­ter­fer­ing with what the plan­ets say is go­ing to hap­pen….They must show that Volde­mort’s com­ing back.…Bane thinks Firen­ze should have let Volde­mort kill me.…I sup­pose that’s writ­ten in the stars as well.”

“Will you stop say­ing the name!” Ron hissed.

“So all I’ve got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone,” Har­ry went on fever­ish­ly, “then Volde­mort will be able to come and fin­ish me off ... Well, I sup­pose Bane’ll be hap­py.”

Hermione looked very fright­ened, but she had a word of com­fort.

“Har­ry, ev­ery­one says Dum­ble­dore’s the on­ly one You-​Know-​Who was ev­er afraid of with Dum­ble­dore around, You-​Know-​Who won’t touch you. Any­way, who says the cen­taurs are right? It sounds like for­tune-​telling to me, and Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall says that’s a very im­pre­cise branch of mag­ic.”

The sky had turned light be­fore they stopped talk­ing. They went to bed ex­haust­ed, their throats sore. But the night’s sur­pris­es weren’t over.

When Har­ry pulled back his sheets, he found his in­vis­ibil­ity cloak fold­ed neat­ly un­der­neath them. There was a note pinned to it:

Just in case.





HP 1 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone





CHAPTER SIXTEEN




THROUGH THE TRAP­DOOR



I n years to come, Har­ry would nev­er quite re­mem­ber how he had man­aged to get through his ex­ams when he half ex­pect­ed Volde­mort to come burst­ing through the door at any mo­ment. Yet the days crept by, and there could be no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and well be­hind the locked door.

It was swel­ter­ing hot, es­pe­cial­ly in the large class­room where they did their writ­ten pa­pers. They had been giv­en spe­cial, new quills for the ex­ams, which had been be­witched with an An­ticheat­ing spell.

They had prac­ti­cal ex­ams as well. Pro­fes­sor Flitwick called them one by one in­to his class to see if they could make a pineap­ple tap­dance across a desk. Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall watched them turn a mouse in­to a snuff­box — points were giv­en for how pret­ty the snuff­box was, but tak­en away if it had whiskers. Snape made them all ner­vous, breath­ing down their necks while they tried to re­mem­ber how to make a For­get­ful­ness po­tion.

Har­ry did the best he could, try­ing to ig­nore the stab­bing pains in his fore­head, which had been both­er­ing him ev­er since his trip in­to the for­est. Neville thought Har­ry had a bad case of ex­am nerves be­cause Har­ry couldn’t sleep, but the truth was that Har­ry kept be­ing wo­ken by his old night­mare, ex­cept that it was now worse than ev­er be­cause there was a hood­ed fig­ure drip­ping blood in it.

Maybe it was be­cause they hadn’t seen what Har­ry had seen in the for­est, or be­cause they didn’t have scars burn­ing on their fore­heads, but Ron and Hermione didn’t seem as wor­ried about the Stone as Har­ry. The idea of Volde­mort cer­tain­ly scared them, but he didn’t keep vis­it­ing them in dreams, and they were so busy with their study­ing they didn’t have much time to fret about what Snape or any­one else might be up to.

Their very last ex­am was His­to­ry of Mag­ic. One hour of an­swer­ing ques­tions about bat­ty old wiz­ards who’d in­vent­ed self­stir­ring caul­drons and they’d be free, free for a whole won­der­ful week un­til their ex­am re­sults came out. When the ghost of Pro­fes­sor Binns told them to put down their quills and roll up their parch­ment, Har­ry couldn’t help cheer­ing with the rest.

“That was far eas­ier than I thought it would be,” said Hermione as they joined the crowds flock­ing out on­to the sun­ny grounds. “I needn’t have learned about the 1637 Were­wolf Code of Con­duct or the up­ris­ing of El­fric the Ea­ger.”

Hermione al­ways liked to go through their ex­am pa­pers af­ter­ward, but Ron said this made him feel ill, so they wan­dered down to the lake and flopped un­der a tree. The Weasley twins and Lee Jor­dan were tick­ling the ten­ta­cles of a gi­ant squid, which was bask­ing in the warm shal­lows. “No more study­ing,” Ron sighed hap­pi­ly, stretch­ing out on the grass. “You could look more cheer­ful, Har­ry, we’ve got a week be­fore we find out how bad­ly we’ve done, there’s no need to wor­ry yet.”

Har­ry was rub­bing his fore­head.

“I wish I knew what this means!” he burst out an­gri­ly. “My scar keeps hurt­ing — it’s hap­pened be­fore, but nev­er as of­ten as this.”

“Go to Madam Pom­frey,” Hermione sug­gest­ed.

“I’m not ill,” said Har­ry. “I think it’s a warn­ing…it means dan­ger’s com­ing….”

Ron couldn’t get worked up, it was too hot.

“Har­ry, re­lax, Hermione’s right, the Stone’s safe as long as Dum­ble­dore’s around. Any­way, we’ve nev­er had any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy. He near­ly had his leg ripped off once, he’s not go­ing to try it again in a hur­ry. And Neville will play Quid­ditch for Eng­land be­fore Ha­grid lets Dum­ble­dore down.”

Har­ry nod­ded, but he couldn’t shake off a lurk­ing feel­ing that there was some­thing he’d for­got­ten to do, some­thing im­por­tant. When he tried to ex­plain this, Hermione said, “That’s just the ex­ams. I woke up last night and was halfway through my Trans­fig­ura­tion notes be­fore I re­mem­bered we’d done that one.”

Har­ry was quite sure the un­set­tled feel­ing didn’t have any­thing to do with work, though. He watched an owl flut­ter to­ward the school across the bright blue sky, a note clamped in its mouth. Ha­grid was the on­ly one who ev­er sent him let­ters. Ha­grid would nev­er be­tray Dum­ble­dore. Ha­grid would nev­er tell any­one how to get past Fluffy…nev­er…but….

Har­ry sud­den­ly jumped to his feet.

“Where’re you go­ing?” said Ron sleep­ily.

“I’ve just thought of some­thing,” said Har­ry. He had turned white. “We’ve got to go and see Ha­grid, now.”

“Why?” pant­ed Hermione, hur­ry­ing to keep up.

“Don’t you think it’s a bit odd,” said Har­ry, scram­bling up the grassy slope, “that what Ha­grid wants more than any­thing else is a drag­on, and a stranger turns up who just hap­pens to have an egg in his pock­et? How many peo­ple wan­der around with drag­on eggs if it’s against wiz­ard law? Lucky they found Ha­grid, don’t you think? Why didn’t I see it be­fore?”

“What are you talk­ing about?” said Ron, but Har­ry, sprint­ing across the grounds to­ward the for­est, didn’t an­swer.

Ha­grid was sit­ting in an arm­chair out­side his house; his trousers and sleeves were rolled up, and he was shelling peas in­to a large bowl.

“Hul­lo,” he said, smil­ing. “Fin­ished yer ex­ams? Got time fer a drink?”

“Yes, please,” said Ron, but Har­ry cut him off.

“No, we’re in a hur­ry. Ha­grid, I’ve got to ask you some­thing. You know that night you won Nor­bert? What did the stranger you were play­ing cards with look like?”

“Dun­no,” said Ha­grid ca­su­al­ly, “he wouldn’ take his cloak off.”

He saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eye­brows.

“It’s not that un­usu­al, yeh get a lot o’ fun­ny folk in the Hog’s Head — that’s the pub down in the vil­lage. Migh­ta bin a drag­on deal­er, mightn’ he? I nev­er saw his face, he kept his hood up.”

Har­ry sank down next to the bowl of peas. “What did you talk to him about, Ha­grid? Did you men­tion Hog­warts at all?”

“Migh­ta come up,” said Ha­grid, frown­ing as he tried to re­mem­ber. “Yeah…he asked what I did, an’ I told him I was game­keep­er here…He asked a bit about the sor­ta crea­tures I took af­ter…so I told him…an’ I said what I’d al­ways re­al­ly want­ed was a drag­on…an’ then…I can’ re­mem­ber too well, ‘cause he kept buyin’ me drinks…Let’s see…yeah, then he said he had the drag­on egg an’ we could play cards fer it if I want­ed…but he had ter be sure I could han­dle it, he didn’ want it ter go ter any old home….So I told him, af­ter Fluffy, a drag­on would be easy.…”

“And did he — did he seem in­ter­est­ed in Fluffy?” Har­ry asked, try­ing to keep his voice calm.

“Well — yeah — how many three-​head­ed dogs d’yeh meet, even around Hog­warts? So I told him, Fluffy’s a piece o’ cake if yeh know how to calm him down, jus’ play him a bit o’ mu­sic an’ he’ll go straight off ter sleep —”

Ha­grid sud­den­ly looked hor­ri­fied.

“I shouldn’ta told yeh that!” he blurt­ed out. “For­get I said it! Hey — where’re yeh goin’?”

Har­ry, Ron, and Hermione didn’t speak to each oth­er at all un­til they came to a halt in the en­trance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy af­ter the grounds.

“We’ve got to go to Dum­ble­dore,” said Har­ry. “Ha­grid told that stranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was ei­ther Snape or Volde­mort un­der that cloak — it must’ve been easy, once he’d got Ha­grid drunk. I just hope Dum­ble­dore be­lieves us. Firen­ze might back us up if Bane doesn’t stop him. Where’s Dum­ble­dore’s of­fice?”

They looked around, as if hop­ing to see a sign point­ing them in the right di­rec­tion. They had nev­er been told where Dum­ble­dore lived, nor did they know any­one who had been sent to see him.

“We’ll just have to —” Har­ry be­gan, but a voice sud­den­ly rang across the hall.

“What are you three do­ing in­side?”

It was Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall, car­ry­ing a large pile of books.

“We want to see Pro­fes­sor Dum­ble­dore,” said Hermione, rather brave­ly, Har­ry and Ron thought.

“See Pro­fes­sor Dum­ble­dore?” Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall re­peat­ed, as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do. “Why?”

Har­ry swal­lowed — now what?

“It’s sort of se­cret,” he said, but he wished at once he hadn’t, be­cause Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall’s nos­trils flared.

“Pro­fes­sor Dum­ble­dore left ten min­utes ago,” she said cold­ly. “He re­ceived an ur­gent owl from the Min­istry of Mag­ic and flew off for Lon­don at once.”

“He’s gone?” said Har­ry fran­ti­cal­ly. “Now?”

“Pro­fes­sor Dum­ble­dore is a very great wiz­ard, Pot­ter, he has many de­mands on his time – ”

“But this is im­por­tant.”

“Some­thing you have to say is more im­por­tant than the Min­istry of Mag­ic, Pot­ter?”

“Look,” said Har­ry, throw­ing cau­tion to the winds, “Pro­fes­sor — it’s about the Sor­cer­er’s Stone —”

What­ev­er Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall had ex­pect­ed, it wasn’t that. The books she was car­ry­ing tum­bled out of her arms, but she didn’t pick them up.

“How do you know —?” she splut­tered.

“Pro­fes­sor, I think — I know — that Sn— that some­one’s go­ing to try and steal the Stone. I’ve got to talk to Pro­fes­sor Dum­ble­dore.”

She eyed him with a mix­ture of shock and sus­pi­cion.

“Pro­fes­sor Dum­ble­dore will be back to­mor­row,” she said fi­nal­ly. I don’t know how you found out about the Stone, but rest as­sured, no one can pos­si­bly steal it, it’s too well pro­tect­ed.”

“But Pro­fes­sor —”

“Pot­ter, I know what I’m talk­ing about,” she said short­ly. She bent down and gath­ered up the fall­en books. I sug­gest you all go back out­side and en­joy the sun­shine.”

But they didn’t.

“It’s tonight,” said Har­ry, once he was sure Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall was out of earshot. “Snape’s go­ing through the trap­door tonight. He’s found out ev­ery­thing he needs, and now he’s got Dum­ble­dore out of the way. He sent that note, I bet the Min­istry of Mag­ic will get a re­al shock when Dum­ble­dore turns up.”

“But what can we —”

Hermione gasped. Har­ry and Ron wheeled round.

Snape was stand­ing there.

“Good af­ter­noon,” he said smooth­ly.

They stared at him.

“You shouldn’t be in­side on a day like this,” he said, with an odd, twist­ed smile.

“We were —” Har­ry be­gan, with­out any idea what he was go­ing to say.

“You want to be more care­ful,” said Snape. “Hang­ing around like this, peo­ple will think you’re up to some­thing. And Gryffind­or re­al­ly can’t af­ford to lose any more points, can it?”

Har­ry flushed. They turned to go out­side, but Snape called them back.

“Be warned, Pot­ter — any more night­time wan­der­ings and I will per­son­al­ly make sure you are ex­pelled. Good day to you.”

He strode off in the di­rec­tion of the staffroom.

Out on the stone steps, Har­ry turned to the oth­ers.

“Right, here’s what we’ve got to do,” he whis­pered ur­gent­ly. “One of us has got to keep an eye on Snape — wait out­side the staff room and fol­low him if he leaves it. Hermione, you’d bet­ter do that.”

“Why me?”

“It’s ob­vi­ous,” said Ron. “You can pre­tend to be wait­ing for Pro­fes­sor Flitwick, you know.” He put on a high voice, “‘Oh Pro­fes­sor Flitwick, I’m so wor­ried, I think I got ques­tion four­teen b wrong….’”

“Oh, shut up,” said Hermione, but she agreed to go and watch out for Snape.

“And we’d bet­ter stay out­side the third-​floor cor­ri­dor,” Har­ry told Ron. “Come on.”

But that part of the plan didn’t work. No soon­er had they reached the door sep­arat­ing Fluffy from the rest of the school than Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall turned up again and this time, she lost her tem­per.

“I sup­pose you think you’re hard­er to get past than a pack of en­chant­ments!” she stormed. “Enough of this non­sense! If I hear you’ve come any­where near here again, I’ll take an­oth­er fifty points from Gryffind­or! Yes, Weasley, from my own house!”

Har­ry and Ron went back to the com­mon room, Har­ry had just said, “At least Hermione’s on Snape’s tail,” when the por­trait of the Fat La­dy swung open and Hermione came in.

“I’m sor­ry, Har­ry!” she wailed. “Snape came out and asked me what I was do­ing, so I said I was wait­ing for Flitwick, and Snape went to get him, and I’ve on­ly just got away, I don’t know where Snape went.”

“Well, that’s it then, isn’t it?” Har­ry said.

The oth­er two stared at him. He was pale and his eyes were glit­ter­ing.

“I’m go­ing out of here tonight and I’m go­ing to try and get to the Stone first.”

“You’re mad!” said Ron.

“You can’t!” said Hermione. “Af­ter what McG­ona­gall and Snape have said? You’ll be ex­pelled!”

“SO WHAT” Har­ry shout­ed. “Don’t you un­der­stand? If Snape gets hold of the Stone, Volde­mort’s com­ing back! Haven’t you heard what it was like when he was try­ing to take over? There won’t be any Hog­warts to get ex­pelled from! He’ll flat­ten it, or turn it in­to a school for the Dark Arts! Los­ing points doesn’t mat­ter any­more, can’t you see? D’you think he’ll leave you and your fam­ilies alone if Gryffind­or wins the house cup? If I get caught be­fore I can get to the Stone, well, I’ll have to go back to the Durs­leys and wait for Volde­mort to find me there, it’s on­ly dy­ing a bit lat­er than I would have, be­cause I’m nev­er go­ing over to the Dark Side! I’m go­ing through that trap­door tonight and noth­ing you two say is go­ing to stop me! Volde­mort killed my par­ents, re­mem­ber?”

He glared at them.

“You’re right Har­ry,” said Hermione in a small voice.

“I’ll use the in­vis­ibil­ity cloak,” said Har­ry. “It’s just lucky I got it back.”

“But will it cov­er all three of us?” said Ron.

“All — all three of us?”

“Oh, come off it, you don’t think we’d let you go alone?”

“Of course not,” said Hermione briskly. “How do you think you’d get to the Stone with­out us? I’d bet­ter go and took through my books, there might be some­thing use­ful….”

“But if we get caught, you two will be ex­pelled, too.”

“Not if I can help it,” said Hermione grim­ly. “Flitwick told me in se­cret that I got a hun­dred and twelve per­cent on his ex­am. They’re not throw­ing me out af­ter that.”



Af­ter din­ner the three of them sat ner­vous­ly apart in the com­mon room. No­body both­ered them; none of the Gryffind­ors had any­thing to say to Har­ry any more, af­ter all. This was the first night he hadn’t been up­set by it. Hermione was skim­ming through all her notes, hop­ing to come across one of the en­chant­ments they were about to try to break. Har­ry and Ron didn’t talk much. Both of them were think­ing about what they were about to do.

Slow­ly, the room emp­tied as peo­ple drift­ed off to bed.

“Bet­ter get the cloak,” Ron mut­tered, as Lee Jor­dan fi­nal­ly left, stretch­ing and yawn­ing. Har­ry ran up­stairs to their dark dor­mi­to­ry. He pulled out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Ha­grid had giv­en him for Christ­mas. He pock­et­ed it to use on Fluffy — he didn’t feel much like singing.

He ran back down to the com­mon room.

“We’d bet­ter put the cloak on here, and make sure it cov­ers all three of us – if Filch spots one of our feet wan­der­ing along on its own —”

“What are you do­ing?” said a voice from the cor­ner of the room. Neville ap­peared from be­hind an arm­chair, clutch­ing Trevor the toad, who looked as though he’d been mak­ing an­oth­er bid for free­dom.

“Noth­ing, Neville, noth­ing,” said Har­ry, hur­ried­ly putting the cloak be­hind his back.

Neville stared at their guilty faces.

“You’re go­ing out again,” he said.

“No, no, no,” said Hermione. “No, we’re not. Why don’t you go to bed, Neville?”

Har­ry looked at the grand­fa­ther clock by the door. They couldn’t af­ford to waste any more time, Snape might even now be play­ing Fluffy to sleep.

“You can’t go out,” said Neville, “you’ll be caught again. Gryffind­or will be in even more trou­ble.”

“You don’t un­der­stand,” said Har­ry, “this is im­por­tant.”

But Neville was clear­ly steel­ing him­self to do some­thing des­per­ate.

I won’t let you do it,” he said, hur­ry­ing to stand in front of the por­trait hole. “I’ll — I’ll fight you!”

“Neville, “Ron ex­plod­ed, “get away from that hole and don’t be an id­iot —”

“Don’t you call me an id­iot!” said Neville. I don’t think you should be break­ing any more rules! And you were the one who told me to stand up to peo­ple!”

“Yes, but not to us,” said Ron in ex­as­per­ation. “Neville, you don’t know what you’re do­ing.”

He took a step for­ward and Neville dropped Trevor the toad, who leapt out of sight.

“Go on then, try and hit me!” said Neville, rais­ing his fists. “I’m ready!”

Har­ry turned to Hermione.

“Do some­thing,” he said des­per­ate­ly.

Hermione stepped for­ward.

“Neville,” she said, “I’m re­al­ly, re­al­ly sor­ry about this.”

She raised her wand.

“Pet­ri­fi­cus To­talus!” she cried, point­ing it at Neville.

Neville’s arms snapped to his sides. His legs sprang to­geth­er. His whole body rigid, he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face, stiff as a board.

Hermione ran to turn him over. Neville’s jaws were jammed to­geth­er so he couldn’t speak. On­ly his eyes were mov­ing, look­ing at them in hor­ror.

“What’ve you done to him?” Har­ry whis­pered.

“It’s the full Body-​Bind,” said Hermione mis­er­ably. “Oh, Neville, I’m so sor­ry.”

“We had to, Neville, no time to ex­plain,” said Har­ry.

“You’ll un­der­stand lat­er, Neville,” said Ron as they stepped over him and pulled on the in­vis­ibil­ity cloak.

But leav­ing Neville ly­ing mo­tion­less on the floor didn’t feel like a very good omen. In their ner­vous state, ev­ery stat­ue’s shad­ow looked like Filch, ev­ery dis­tant breath of wind sound­ed like Peeves swoop­ing down on them. At the foot of the first set of stairs, they spot­ted Mrs. Nor­ris skulk­ing near the top.

“Oh, let’s kick her, just this once,” Ron whis­pered in Har­ry’s ear, but Har­ry shook his head. As they climbed care­ful­ly around her, Mrs. Nor­ris turned her lam­plike eyes on them, but didn’t do any­thing.

They didn’t meet any­one else un­til they reached the stair­case up to the third floor. Peeves was bob­bing halfway up, loos­en­ing the car­pet so that peo­ple would trip.

“Who’s there?” he said sud­den­ly as they climbed to­ward him. He nar­rowed his wicked black eyes. “Know you’re there, even if I can’t see you. Are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee stu­dent beast­ie?”

He rose up in the air and float­ed there, squint­ing at them.

“Should call Filch, I should, if some­thing’s a-​creep­ing around un­seen.”

Har­ry had a sud­den idea.

“Peeves,” he said, in a hoarse whis­per, “the Bloody Baron has his own rea­sons for be­ing in­vis­ible.”

Peeves al­most fell out of the air in shock. He caught him­self in time and hov­ered about a foot off the stairs.

“So sor­ry, your blood­iness, Mr. Baron, Sir,” he said greasi­ly. “My mis­take, my mis­take — I didn’t see you — of course I didn’t, you’re in­vis­ible — for­give old Peevsie his lit­tle joke, sir.”

“I have busi­ness here, Peeves,” croaked Har­ry. “Stay away from this place tonight.”

“I will, sir, I most cer­tain­ly will,” said Peeves, ris­ing up in the air again. “Hope your busi­ness goes well, Baron, I’ll not both­er you.”

And he scoot­ed off.

“Bril­liant, Har­ry!” whis­pered Ron.

A few sec­onds lat­er, they were there, out­side the third-​floor cor­ri­dor — and the door was al­ready ajar.

“Well, there you are,” Har­ry said qui­et­ly, “Snape’s al­ready got past Fluffy.”

See­ing the open door some­how seemed to im­press up­on all three of them what was fac­ing them. Un­der­neath the cloak, Har­ry turned to the oth­er two.

“If you want to go back, I won’t blame you,” he said. “You can take the cloak, I won’t need it now.”

“Don’t be stupid,” said Ron.

“We’re com­ing,” said Hermione.

Har­ry pushed the door open.

As the door creaked, low, rum­bling growls met their ears. All three of the dog’s noses sniffed mad­ly in their di­rec­tion, even though it couldn’t see them.

“What’s that at its feet?” Hermione whis­pered.

“Looks like a harp,” said Ron. “Snape must have left it there.”

“It must wake up the mo­ment you stop play­ing,” said Har­ry. “Well, here goes ….”

He put Ha­grid’s flute to his lips and blew. It wasn’t re­al­ly a tune, but from the first note the beast’s eyes be­gan to droop. Har­ry hard­ly drew breath. Slow­ly, the dog’s growls ceased — it tot­tered on its paws and fell to its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast asleep.

“Keep play­ing,” Ron warned Har­ry as they slipped out of the cloak and crept to­ward the trap­door. They could feel the dog’s hot, smelly breath as they ap­proached the gi­ant heads. “I think we’ll be able to pull the door open,” said Ron, peer­ing over the dog’s back. “Want to go first, Hermione?”

“No, I don’t!”

“All right.” Ron grit­ted his teeth and stepped care­ful­ly over the dog’s legs. He bent and pulled the ring of the trap­door, which swung up and open.

“What can you see?” Hermione said anx­ious­ly.

“Noth­ing — just black — there’s no way of climb­ing down, we’ll just have to drop.”

Har­ry, who was still play­ing the flute, waved at Ron to get his at­ten­tion and point­ed at him­self.

“You want to go first? Are you sure?” said Ron. “I don’t know how deep this thing goes. Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep.”

Har­ry hand­ed the flute over. In the few sec­onds’ si­lence, the dog growled and twitched, but the mo­ment Hermione be­gan to play, it fell back in­to its deep sleep.

Har­ry climbed over it and looked down through the trap­door. There was no sign of the bot­tom.

He low­ered him­self through the hole un­til he was hang­ing on by his fin­ger­tips. Then he looked up at Ron and said, “If any­thing hap­pens to me, don’t fol­low. Go straight to the owlery and send Hed­wig to Dum­ble­dore, right?”

“Right,” said Ron.

“See you in a minute, I hope …”

And Har­ry let go. Cold, damp air rushed past him as he fell down, down, down and —

FLUMP. With a fun­ny, muf­fled sort of thump he land­ed on some­thing soft. He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the gloom. It felt as though he was sit­ting on some sort of plant.

“It’s okay!” he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp, which was the open trap­door, “it’s a soft land­ing, you can jump!”

Ron fol­lowed right away. He land­ed, sprawled next to Har­ry.

“What’s this stuff?” were his first words.

“Dun­no, some sort of plant thing. I sup­pose it’s here to break the fall. Come on, Hermione!”

The dis­tant mu­sic stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, but Hermione had al­ready jumped. She land­ed on Har­ry’s oth­er side.

“We must be miles un­der the school,” she said.

“Lucky this plant thing’s here, re­al­ly,” said Ron.

“Lucky!” shrieked Hermione. “Look at you both!”

She leapt up and strug­gled to­ward a damp wall. She had to strug­gle be­cause the mo­ment she had land­ed, the plant had start­ed to twist snake­like ten­drils around her an­kles. As for Har­ry and Ron, their legs had al­ready been bound tight­ly in long creep­ers with­out their notic­ing.

Hermione had man­aged to free her­self be­fore the plant got a firm grip on her. Now she watched in hor­ror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster the plant wound around them.

“Stop mov­ing!” Hermione or­dered them. “I know what this is — it’s Dev­il’s Snare!”

“Oh, I’m so glad we know what it’s called, that’s a great help,” snarled Ron, lean­ing back, try­ing to stop the plant from curl­ing around his neck. “Shut up, I’m try­ing to re­mem­ber how to kill it!” said Hermione.

“Well, hur­ry up, I can’t breathe!” Har­ry gasped, wrestling with it as it curled around his chest.

“Dev­il’s Snare, Dev­il’s Snare…what did Pro­fes­sor Sprout say? — it likes the dark and the damp.”

“So light a fire!” Har­ry choked.

“Yes — of course — but there’s no wood!” Hermione cried, wring­ing her hands.

“HAVE YOU GONE MAD?” Ron bel­lowed. “ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?”

“Oh, right!” said Hermione, and she whipped out her wand, waved it, mut­tered some­thing, and sent a jet of the same blue­bell flames she had used on Snape at the plant. In a mat­ter of sec­onds, the two boys felt it loos­en­ing its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth. Wrig­gling and flail­ing, it un­rav­eled it­self from their bod­ies, and they were able to pull free.

“Lucky you pay at­ten­tion in Her­bol­ogy, Hermione,” said Har­ry as he joined her by the wall, wip­ing sweat off his face.

“Yeah,” said Ron, “and lucky Har­ry doesn’t lose his head in a cri­sis — ‘there’s no wood,’ hon­est­ly.”

“This way,” said Har­ry, point­ing down a stone pas­sage­way, which was the on­ly way for­ward.

All they could hear apart from their foot­steps was the gen­tle drip of wa­ter trick­ling down the walls. The pas­sage­way sloped down­ward, and Har­ry was re­mind­ed of Gringotts. With an un­pleas­ant jolt of the heart, he re­mem­bered the drag­ons said to be guard­ing vaults in the wiz­ards’ bank. If they met a drag­on, a ful­ly-​grown drag­on — Nor­bert had been bad enough….

“Can you hear some­thing?” Ron whis­pered.

Har­ry lis­tened. A soft rustling and clink­ing seemed to be com­ing from up ahead.

“Do you think it’s a ghost?”

“I don’t know…sounds like wings to me.”

“There’s light ahead — I can see some­thing mov­ing.”

They reached the end of the pas­sage­way and saw be­fore them a bril­liant­ly lit cham­ber, its ceil­ing arch­ing high above them. It was full of small, jew­el-​bright birds, flut­ter­ing and tum­bling all around the room. On the op­po­site side of the cham­ber was a heavy wood­en door.

“Do you think they’ll at­tack us if we cross the room?” said Ron.

“Prob­ably,” said Har­ry. “They don’t look very vi­cious, but I sup­pose if they all swooped down at once…well, there’s no oth­er choice…I’ll run.”

He took a deep breath, cov­ered his face with his arms, and sprint­ed across the room. He ex­pect­ed to feel sharp beaks and claws tear­ing at him any sec­ond, but noth­ing hap­pened. He reached the door un­touched. He pulled the han­dle, but it was locked.

The oth­er two fol­lowed him. They tugged and heaved at the door, but it wouldn’t budge, not even when Hermione tried her Alo­homo­ra charm.

“Now what?” said Ron.

“These birds…they can’t be here just for dec­ora­tion,” said Hermione.

They watched the birds soar­ing over­head, glit­ter­ing — glit­ter­ing?

“They’re not birds!” Har­ry said sud­den­ly. “They’re keys! Winged keys — look care­ful­ly. So that must mean…” he looked around the cham­ber while the oth­er two squint­ed up at the flock of keys. “…yes — look! Broom­sticks! We’ve got to catch the key to the door!”

“But there are hun­dreds of them!”

Ron ex­am­ined the lock on the door.

“We’re look­ing for a big, old-​fash­ioned one — prob­ably sil­ver, like the han­dle.”

They each seized a broom­stick and kicked off in­to the air, soar­ing in­to the midst of the cloud of keys. They grabbed and snatched, but the be­witched keys dart­ed and dived so quick­ly it was al­most im­pos­si­ble to catch one.

Not for noth­ing, though, was Har­ry the youngest Seek­er in a cen­tu­ry. He had a knack for spot­ting things oth­er peo­ple didn’t. Af­ter a minute’s weav­ing about through the whirl of rain­bow feath­ers, he no­ticed a large sil­ver key that had a bent wing, as if it had al­ready been caught and stuffed rough­ly in­to the key­hole.

“That one!” he called to the oth­ers. “That big one — there — no, there — with bright blue wings — the feath­ers are all crum­pled on one side.”

Ron went speed­ing in the di­rec­tion that Har­ry was point­ing, crashed in­to the ceil­ing, and near­ly fell off his broom.

“We’ve got to close in on it!” Har­ry called, not tak­ing his eyes off the key with the dam­aged wing. “Ron, you come at it from above — Hermione, stay be­low and stop it from go­ing down and I’ll try and catch it. Right, NOW!”

Ron dived, Hermione rock­et­ed up­ward, the key dodged them both, and Har­ry streaked af­ter it; it sped to­ward the wall, Har­ry leaned for­ward and with a nasty, crunch­ing noise, pinned it against the stone with one hand. Ron and Hermione’s cheers echoed around the high cham­ber.

They land­ed quick­ly, and Har­ry ran to the door, the key strug­gling in his hand. He rammed it in­to the lock and turned – it worked. The mo­ment the lock had clicked open, the key took flight again, look­ing very bat­tered now that it had been caught twice.

“Ready?” Har­ry asked the oth­er two, his hand on the door han­dle. They nod­ded. He pulled the door open.

The next cham­ber was so dark they couldn’t see any­thing at all. But as they stepped in­to it, light sud­den­ly flood­ed the room to re­veal an as­ton­ish­ing sight.

They were stand­ing on the edge of a huge chess­board, be­hind the black chess­men, which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like black stone. Fac­ing them, way across the cham­ber, were the white pieces. Har­ry, Ron and Hermione shiv­ered slight­ly – the tow­er­ing white chess­men had no faces.

“Now what do we do?” Har­ry whis­pered.

“It’s ob­vi­ous, isn’t it?” said Ron. “We’ve got to play our way across the room.”

Be­hind the white pieces they could see an­oth­er door.

“How?” said Hermione ner­vous­ly.

“I think,” said Ron, “we’re go­ing to have to be chess­men.”

He walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knight’s horse. At once, the stone sprang to life. The horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his hel­met­ed head to look down at Ron.

“Do we — er — have to join you to get across?” The black knight nod­ded. Ron turned to the oth­er two.

“This needs think­ing about…” he said. “I sup­pose we’ve got to take the place of three of the black pieces….”

Har­ry and Hermione stayed qui­et, watch­ing Ron think. Fi­nal­ly he said, “Now, don’t be of­fend­ed or any­thing, but nei­ther of you are that good at chess —”

“We’re not of­fend­ed,” said Har­ry quick­ly. “Just tell us what to do.”

“Well, Har­ry, you take the place of that bish­op, and Hermione, you next to him in­stead of that cas­tle.”

“What about you?”

“I’m go­ing to be a knight,” said Ron.

The chess­men seemed to have been lis­ten­ing, be­cause at these words a knight, a bish­op, and a cas­tle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board, leav­ing three emp­ty squares that Har­ry, Ron, and Hermione took.

“White al­ways plays first in chess,” said Ron, peer­ing across the board. “Yes…look…”

A white pawn had moved for­ward two squares.

Ron start­ed to di­rect the black pieces. They moved silent­ly wher­ev­er he sent them. Har­ry’s knees were trem­bling. What if they lost?

“Har­ry — move di­ag­onal­ly four squares to the right.”

Their first re­al shock came when their oth­er knight was tak­en. The white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board, where he lay quite still, face­down.

“Had to let that hap­pen,” said Ron, look­ing shak­en. “Leaves you free to take that bish­op, Hermione, go on.”

Ev­ery time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed no mer­cy. Soon there was a hud­dle of limp black play­ers slumped along the wall. Twice, Ron on­ly just no­ticed in time that Har­ry and Hermione were in dan­ger. He him­self dart­ed around the board, tak­ing al­most as many white pieces as they had lost black ones.

“We’re near­ly there,” he mut­tered sud­den­ly. “Let me think — let me think…”

The white queen turned her blank face to­ward him.

“Yes…” said Ron soft­ly, “It’s the on­ly way…I’ve got to be tak­en.”

“NO!” Har­ry and Hermione shout­ed.

“That’s chess!” snapped Ron. “You’ve got to make some sac­ri­fices! I take one step for­ward and she’ll take me — that leaves you free to check­mate the king, Har­ry!”

“But —”

“Do you want to stop Snape or not?”

“Ron —”

“Look, if you don’t hur­ry up, he’ll al­ready have the Stone!”

There was no al­ter­na­tive.

“Ready?” Ron called, his face pale but de­ter­mined. “Here I go — now, don’t hang around once you’ve won.”

He stepped for­ward, and the white queen pounced. She struck Ron hard across the head with her stone arm, and he crashed to the floor — Hermione screamed but stayed on her square — the white queen dragged Ron to one side. He looked as if he’d been knocked out.

Shak­ing, Har­ry moved three spaces to the left.

The white king took off his crown and threw it at Har­ry’s feet. They had won. The chess­men part­ed and bowed, leav­ing the door ahead clear. With one last des­per­ate look back at Ron, Har­ry and Hermione charged through the door and up the next pas­sage­way.

“What if he’s —?”

“He’ll be all right,” said Har­ry, try­ing to con­vince him­self. “What do you reck­on’s next?”

“We’ve had Sprout’s, that was the Dev­il’s Snare; Flitwick must’ve put charms on the keys; McG­ona­gall trans­fig­ured the chess­men to make them alive; that leaves Quir­rell’s spell, and Snape’s.”

They had reached an­oth­er door.

“All right?” Har­ry whis­pered.

“Go on.”

Har­ry pushed it open.

A dis­gust­ing smell filled their nos­trils, mak­ing both of them pull their robes up over their noses. Eyes wa­ter­ing, they saw, flat on the floor in front of them, a troll even larg­er than the one they had tack­led, out cold with a bloody lump on its head.

“I’m glad we didn’t have to fight that one,” Har­ry whis­pered as they stepped care­ful­ly over one of its mas­sive legs. “Come on, I can’t breathe.”

He pulled open the next door, both of them hard­ly dar­ing to look at what came next - but there was noth­ing very fright­en­ing in here, just a ta­ble with sev­en dif­fer­ent­ly shaped bot­tles stand­ing on it in a line.

“Snape’s,” said Har­ry. “What do we have to do?”

They stepped over the thresh­old, and im­me­di­ate­ly a fire sprang up be­hind them in the door­way. It wasn’t or­di­nary fire ei­ther; it was pur­ple. At the same in­stant, black flames shot up in the door­way lead­ing on­ward. They were trapped.

“Look!” Hermione seized a roll of pa­per ly­ing next to the bot­tles. Har­ry looked over her shoul­der to read it:



Dan­ger lies be­fore you, while safe­ty lies be­hind,

Two of us will help you, which ev­er you would find,

One among us sev­en will let you move ahead,

An­oth­er will trans­port the drinker back in­stead,

Two among our num­ber hold on­ly net­tle wine,

Three of us are killers, wait­ing bid­den in line.

Choose, un­less you wish to stay here forever­more,

To help you in your choice, we give you these clues four:

First, how­ev­er sly­ly the poi­son tries to hide

You will al­ways find some on net­tle wine’s left side;

Sec­ond, dif­fer­ent are those who stand at ei­ther end,

But if you would move on­ward, nei­ther is your friend;

Third, as you see clear­ly, all are dif­fer­ent size,

Nei­ther dwarf nor gi­ant holds death in their in­sides;

Fourth, the sec­ond left and the sec­ond on the right

Are twins once you taste them, though dif­fer­ent at first sight.



Hermione let out a great sigh and Har­ry, amazed, saw that she was smil­ing, the very last thing he felt like do­ing.

“Bril­liant,” said Hermione. “This isn’t mag­ic — it’s log­ic — a puz­zle. A lot of the great­est wiz­ards haven’t got an ounce of log­ic, they’d be stuck in here for­ev­er.”

“But so will we, won’t we?”

“Of course not,” said Hermione. “Ev­ery­thing we need is here on this pa­per. Sev­en bot­tles: three are poi­son; two are wine; one will get us safe­ly through the black fire, and one will get us back through the pur­ple.”

“But how do we know which to drink?”

“Give me a minute.”

Hermione read the pa­per sev­er­al times. Then she walked up and down the line of bot­tles, mut­ter­ing to her­self and point­ing at them. At last, she clapped her hands.

“Got it,” she said. “The small­est bot­tle will get us through the black

fire — to­ward the Stone.”

Har­ry looked at the tiny bot­tle.

“There’s on­ly enough there for one of us,” he said. “That’s hard­ly one swal­low.”

They looked at each oth­er.

“Which one will get you back through the pur­ple flames?”

Hermione point­ed at a round­ed bot­tle at the right end of the line.

“You drink that,” said Har­ry. “No, lis­ten, get back and get Ron. Grab brooms from the fly­ing-​key room, they’ll get you out of the trap­door and past Fluffy — go straight to the owlery and send Hed­wig to Dum­ble­dore, we need him. I might be able to hold Snape off for a while, but I’m no match for him, re­al­ly.”

“But Har­ry — what if You-​Know-​Who’s with him?”

“Well — I was lucky once, wasn’t I?” said Har­ry, point­ing at his scar. “I might get lucky again.”

Hermione’s lip trem­bled, and she sud­den­ly dashed at Har­ry and threw her arms around him.

“Hermione!”

“Har­ry — you’re a great wiz­ard, you know.”

“I’m not as good as you,” said Har­ry, very em­bar­rassed, as she let go of him.

“Me!” said Hermione. “Books! And clev­er­ness! There are more im­por­tant things — friend­ship and brav­ery and — oh Har­ry — be care­ful!”

“You drink first,” said Har­ry. “You are sure which is which, aren’t you?”

“Pos­itive,” said Hermione. She took a long drink from the round bot­tle at the end, and shud­dered.

“It’s not poi­son?” said Har­ry anx­ious­ly.

“No — but it’s like ice.”

“Quick, go, be­fore it wears off.”

“Good luck — take care.”

“GO!”

Hermione turned and walked straight through the pur­ple fire.

Har­ry took a deep breath and picked up the small­est bot­tle. He turned to face the black flames.

“Here I come,” he said, and he drained the lit­tle bot­tle in one gulp.

It was in­deed as though ice was flood­ing his body. He put the bot­tle down and walked for­ward; he braced him­self, saw the black flames lick­ing his body, but couldn’t feel them — for a mo­ment he could see noth­ing but dark fire — then he was on the oth­er side, in the last cham­ber.

There was al­ready some­one there — but it wasn’t Snape. It wasn’t even Volde­mort.





HP 1 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone





CHAPTER SEVENTEEN




THE MAN WITH TWO FACES



I t was Quir­rell.

“You!” gasped Har­ry.

Quir­rell smiled. His face wasn’t twitch­ing at all.

“Me,” he said calm­ly. “I won­dered whether I’d be meet­ing you here, Pot­ter.”

“But I thought — Snape —”

“Severus?” Quir­rell laughed, and it wasn’t his usu­al quiv­er­ing tre­ble, ei­ther, but cold and sharp. “Yes, Severus does seem the type, doesn’t he? So use­ful to have him swoop­ing around like an over­grown bat. Next to him, who would sus­pect p-​p-​poor, st-​stut­ter­ing P-​Pro­fes­sor Quir­rell?”

Har­ry couldn’t take it in. This couldn’t be true, it couldn’t.

“But Snape tried to kill me!”

“No, no, no. I tried to kill you. Your friend Miss Granger ac­ci­den­tal­ly knocked me over as she rushed to set fire to Snape at that Quid­ditch match. She broke my eye con­tact with you. An­oth­er few sec­onds and I’d have got you off that broom. I’d have man­aged it be­fore then if Snape hadn’t been mut­ter­ing a coun­ter­curse, try­ing to save you.”

“Snape was try­ing to save me?”

“Of course,” said Quir­rell cool­ly. “Why do you think he want­ed to ref­er­ee your next match? He was try­ing to make sure I didn’t do it again. Fun­ny, re­al­ly…he needn’t have both­ered. I couldn’t do any­thing with Dum­ble­dore watch­ing. All the oth­er teach­ers thought Snape was try­ing to stop Gryffind­or from win­ning, he did make him­self un­pop­ular…and what a waste of time, when af­ter all that, I’m go­ing to kill you tonight.”

Quir­rell snapped his fin­gers. Ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped them­selves tight­ly around Har­ry.

“You’re too nosy to live, Pot­ter. Scur­ry­ing around the school on Hal­loween like that, for all I knew you’d seen me com­ing to look at what was guard­ing the Stone.”

“You let the troll in?”

“Cer­tain­ly. I have a spe­cial gift with trolls — you must have seen what I did to the one in the cham­ber back there? Un­for­tu­nate­ly, while ev­ery­one else was run­ning around look­ing for it, Snape, who al­ready sus­pect­ed me, went straight to the third floor to head me off — and not on­ly did my troll fail to beat you to death, that three-​head­ed dog didn’t even man­age to bite Snape’s leg off prop­er­ly.

“Now, wait qui­et­ly, Pot­ter. I need to ex­am­ine this in­ter­est­ing mir­ror.”

It was on­ly then that Har­ry re­al­ized what was stand­ing be­hind Quir­rell. It was the Mir­ror of Erised.

“This mir­ror is the key to find­ing the Stone,” Quir­rell mur­mured, tap­ping his way around the frame. “Trust Dum­ble­dore to come up with some­thing like this…but he’s in Lon­don…I’ll be far away by the time he gets back…”

All Har­ry could think of do­ing was to keep Quir­rell talk­ing and stop him from con­cen­trat­ing on the mir­ror.

“I saw you and Snape in the for­est —” he blurt­ed out.

“Yes,” said Quir­rell idly, walk­ing around the mir­ror to look at the back. “He was on to me by that time, try­ing to find out how far I’d got. He sus­pect­ed me all along. Tried to fright­en me — as though he could, when I had Lord Volde­mort on my side….”

Quir­rell came back out from be­hind the mir­ror and stared hun­gri­ly in­to it.

“I see the Stone…I’m pre­sent­ing it to my mas­ter…but where is it?”

Har­ry strug­gled against the ropes bind­ing him, but they didn’t give. He had to keep Quir­rell from giv­ing his whole at­ten­tion to the mir­ror.

“But Snape al­ways seemed to hate me so much.”

“Oh, he does,” said Quir­rell ca­su­al­ly, “heav­ens, yes. He was at Hog­warts with your fa­ther, didn’t you know? They loathed each oth­er. But he nev­er want­ed you dead.”

“But I heard you a few days ago, sob­bing — I thought Snape was threat­en­ing you.…”

For the first time, a spasm of fear flit­ted across Quir­rell’s face.

“Some­times,” he said, “I find it hard to fol­low my mas­ter’s in­struc­tions — he is a great wiz­ard and I am weak —”

“You mean he was there in the class­room with you?” Har­ry gasped.

“He is with me wher­ev­er I go,” said Quir­rell qui­et­ly. “I met him when I trav­eled around the world. A fool­ish young man I was then, full of ridicu­lous ideas about good and evil. Lord Volde­mort showed me how wrong I was. There is no good and evil, there is on­ly pow­er, and those too weak to seek it…Since then, I have served him faith­ful­ly, al­though I have let him down many times. He has had to be very hard on me.” Quir­rell shiv­ered sud­den­ly. “He does not for­give mis­takes eas­ily. When I failed to steal the stone from Gringotts, he was most dis­pleased. He pun­ished me…de­cid­ed he would have to keep a clos­er watch on me.…”

Quir­rell’s voice trailed away. Har­ry was re­mem­ber­ing his trip to Di­agon Al­ley — how could he have been so stupid? He’d seen Quir­rell there that very day, shak­en hands with him in the Leaky Caul­dron.

Quir­rell cursed un­der his breath.

“I don’t un­der­stand…is the Stone in­side the mir­ror? Should I break it?”

Har­ry’s mind was rac­ing.

What I want more than any­thing else in the world at the mo­ment, he thought, is to find the Stone be­fore Quir­rell does. So if I look in the mir­ror, I should see my­self find­ing it — which means I’ll see where it’s hid­den! But how can I look with­out Quir­rell re­al­iz­ing what I’m up to?

He tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass with­out Quir­rell notic­ing, but the ropes around his an­kles were too tight: he tripped and fell over. Quir­rell ig­nored him. He was still talk­ing to him­self.

“What does this mir­ror do? How does it work? Help me, Mas­ter!”

And to Har­ry’s hor­ror, a voice an­swered, and the voice seemed to come from Quir­rell him­self.

“Use the boy…Use the boy.…”

Quir­rell round­ed on Har­ry.

“Yes — Pot­ter — come here.”

He clapped his hands once, and the ropes bind­ing Har­ry fell off. Har­ry got slow­ly to his feet.

“Come here,” Quir­rell re­peat­ed. “Look in the mir­ror and tell me what you see.”

Har­ry walked to­ward him.

I must lie, he thought des­per­ate­ly. I must look and lie about what I see, that’s all.

Quir­rell moved close be­hind him. Har­ry breathed in the fun­ny smell that seemed to come from Quir­rell’s tur­ban. He closed his eyes, stepped in front of the mir­ror, and opened them again.

He saw his re­flec­tion, pale and scared-​look­ing at first. But a mo­ment lat­er, the re­flec­tion smiled at him. It put its hand in­to its pock­et and pulled out a blood-​red stone. It winked and put the Stone back in its pock­et — and as it did so, Har­ry felt some­thing heavy drop in­to his re­al pock­et. Some­how — in­cred­ibly — he’d got­ten the Stone.

“Well?” said Quir­rell im­pa­tient­ly. “What do you see?”

Har­ry screwed up his courage.

“I see my­self shak­ing hands with Dum­ble­dore,” he in­vent­ed. “I — I’ve won the house cup for Gryffind­or.”

Quir­rell cursed again.

“Get out of the way,” he said. As Har­ry moved aside, he felt the Sor­cer­er’s Stone against his leg. Dare he make a break for it?

But he hadn’t walked five paces be­fore a high voice spoke, though Quir­rell wasn’t mov­ing his lips.

“He lies…He lies.…”

“Pot­ter, come back here!” Quir­rell shout­ed. “Tell me the truth! What did you just see?”

The high voice spoke again.

“Let me speak to him…face-​to-​face…”

“Mas­ter, you are not strong enough!”

“I have strength enough…for this…”

Har­ry felt as if Dev­il’s Snare was root­ing him to the spot. He couldn’t move a mus­cle. Pet­ri­fied, he watched as Quir­rell reached up and be­gan to un­wrap his tur­ban. What was go­ing on? The tur­ban fell away. Quir­rell’s head looked strange­ly small with­out it. Then he turned slow­ly on the spot.

Har­ry would have screamed, but he couldn’t make a sound. Where there should have been a back to Quir­rell’s head, there was a face, the most ter­ri­ble face Har­ry had ev­er seen. It was chalk white with glar­ing red eyes and slits for nos­trils, like a snake.

“Har­ry Pot­ter…” it whis­pered.

Har­ry tried to take a step back­ward but his legs wouldn’t move.

“See what I have be­come?” the face said. “Mere shad­ow and va­por….I have form on­ly when I can share an­oth­er’s body…but there have al­ways been those will­ing to let me in­to their hearts and minds…Uni­corn blood has strength­ened me, these past weeks…you saw faith­ful Quir­rell drink­ing it for me in the for­est…and once I have the Elixir of Life, I will be able to cre­ate a body of my own….Now…why don’t you give me that Stone in your pock­et?”

So he knew. The feel­ing sud­den­ly surged back in­to Har­ry’s legs. He stum­bled back­ward.

“Don’t be a fool,” snarled the face. “Bet­ter save your own life and join me…or you’ll meet the same end as your par­ents…They died beg­ging me for mer­cy…”

“LIAR!” Har­ry shout­ed sud­den­ly.

Quir­rell was walk­ing back­ward at him, so that Volde­mort could still see him. The evil face was now smil­ing.

“How touch­ing…” it hissed. “I al­ways val­ue brav­ery….Yes, boy, your par­ents were brave…I killed your fa­ther first; and he put up a coura­geous fight…but your moth­er needn’t have died…she was try­ing to pro­tect you…Now give me the Stone, un­less you want her to have died in vain.”

“NEV­ER!”

Har­ry sprang to­ward the flame door, but Volde­mort screamed “SEIZE HIM!” and the next sec­ond, Har­ry felt Quir­rell’s hand close on his wrist. At once, a nee­dle-​sharp pain seared across Har­ry’s scar; his head felt as though it was about to split in two; he yelled, strug­gling with all his might, and to his sur­prise, Quir­rell let go of him. The pain in his head less­ened — he looked around wild­ly to see where Quir­rell had gone, and saw him hunched in pain, look­ing at his fin­gers — they were blis­ter­ing be­fore his eyes.

“Seize him! SEIZE HIM!” shrieked Volde­mort again, and Quir­rell lunged, knock­ing Har­ry clean off his feet land­ing on top of him, both hands around Har­ry’s neck — Har­ry’s scar was al­most blind­ing him with pain, yet he could see Quir­rell howl­ing in agony.

“Mas­ter, I can­not hold him — my hands — my hands!”

And Quir­rell, though pin­ning Har­ry to the ground with his knees, let go of his neck and stared, be­wil­dered, at his own palms — Har­ry could see they looked burned, raw, red, and shiny.

“Then kill him, fool, and be done!” screeched Volde­mort.

Quir­rell raised his hand to per­form a dead­ly curse, but Har­ry, by in­stinct, reached up and grabbed Quir­rell’s face —

“AAAARGH!”

Quir­rell rolled off him, his face blis­ter­ing, too, and then Har­ry knew: Quir­rell couldn’t touch his bare skin, not with­out suf­fer­ing ter­ri­ble pain — his on­ly chance was to keep hold of Quir­rell, keep him in enough pain to stop him from do­ing a curse.

Har­ry jumped to his feet, caught Quir­rell by the arm, and hung on as tight as he could. Quir­rell screamed and tried to throw Har­ry off — the pain in Har­ry’s head was build­ing — he couldn’t see — he could on­ly hear Quir­rell’s ter­ri­ble shrieks and Volde­mort’s yells of, “KILL HIM! KILL HIM!” and oth­er voic­es, maybe in Har­ry’s own head, cry­ing, “Har­ry! Har­ry!”

He felt Quir­rell’s arm wrenched from his grasp, knew all was lost, and fell in­to black­ness, down…down… down….



Some­thing gold was glint­ing just above him. The Snitch! He tried to catch it, but his arms were too heavy.

He blinked. It wasn’t the Snitch at all. It was a pair of glass­es. How strange.

He blinked again. The smil­ing face of Al­bus Dum­ble­dore swam in­to view above him.

“Good af­ter­noon, Har­ry,” said Dum­ble­dore.

Har­ry stared at him. Then he re­mem­bered: “Sir! The Stone! It was Quir­rell! He’s got the Stone! Sir, quick —”

“Calm your­self, dear boy, you are a lit­tle be­hind the times,” said Dum­ble­dore. “Quir­rell does not have the Stone.”

“Then who does? Sir, I —”

“Har­ry, please re­lax, or Madam Pom­frey will have me thrown out.”

Har­ry swal­lowed and looked around him. He re­al­ized he must be in the hos­pi­tal wing. He was ly­ing in a bed with white linen sheets, and next to him was a ta­ble piled high with what looked like half the can­dy shop.

“To­kens from your friends and ad­mir­ers,” said Dum­ble­dore, beam­ing. “What hap­pened down in the dun­geons be­tween you and Pro­fes­sor Quir­rell is a com­plete se­cret, so, nat­ural­ly, the whole school knows. I be­lieve your friends Mis­ters Fred and George Weasley were re­spon­si­ble for try­ing to send you a toi­let seat. No doubt they thought it would amuse you. Madam Pom­frey, how­ev­er, felt it might not be very hy­gien­ic, and con­fis­cat­ed it.”

“How long have I been in here?”

“Three days. Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger will be most re­lieved you have come round, they have been ex­treme­ly wor­ried.”

“But sir, the Stone —”

“I see you are not to be dis­tract­ed. Very well, the Stone. Pro­fes­sor Quir­rell did not man­age to take it from you. I ar­rived in time to pre­vent that, al­though you were do­ing very well on your own, I must say.”

“You got there? You got Hermione’s owl?”

“We must have crossed in midair. No soon­er had I reached Lon­don than it be­came clear to me that the place I should be was the one I had just left. I ar­rived just in time to pull Quir­rell off you.”

“It was you.”

“I feared I might be too late.”

“You near­ly were, I couldn’t have kept him off the Stone much longer –”

“Not the Stone, boy, you — the ef­fort in­volved near­ly killed you. For one ter­ri­ble mo­ment there, I was afraid it had. As for the Stone, it has been de­stroyed.”

“De­stroyed?” said Har­ry blankly. “But your friend — Nico­las Flamel —”

“Oh, you know about Nico­las?” said Dum­ble­dore, sound­ing quite de­light­ed. “You did do the thing prop­er­ly, didn’t you? Well, Nico­las and I have had a lit­tle chat, and agreed it’s all for the best.”

“But that means he and his wife will die, won’t they?”

“They have enough Elixir stored to set their af­fairs in or­der and then, yes, they will die.”

Dum­ble­dore smiled at the look of amaze­ment on Har­ry’s face.

“To one as young as you, I’m sure it seems in­cred­ible, but to Nico­las and Perenelle, it re­al­ly is like go­ing to bed af­ter a very, very long day. Af­ter all, to the well-​or­ga­nized mind, death is but the next great ad­ven­ture. You know, the Stone was re­al­ly not such a won­der­ful thing. As much mon­ey and life as you could want! The two things most hu­man be­ings would choose above all — the trou­ble is, hu­mans do have a knack of choos­ing pre­cise­ly those things that are worst for them.”

Har­ry lay there, lost for words. Dum­ble­dore hummed a lit­tle and smiled at the ceil­ing.

“Sir?” said Har­ry. “I’ve been think­ing…sir — even if the Stone’s gone, Vol-, I mean, You-​Know-​Who —”

“Call him Volde­mort, Har­ry. Al­ways use the prop­er name for things. Fear of a name in­creas­es fear of the thing it­self.”

“Yes, sir. Well, Volde­mort’s go­ing to try oth­er ways of com­ing back, isn’t he? I mean, he hasn’t gone, has he?”

“No, Har­ry, he has not. He is still out there some­where, per­haps look­ing for an­oth­er body to share…not be­ing tru­ly alive, he can­not be killed. He left Quir­rell to die; he shows just as lit­tle mer­cy to his fol­low­ers as his en­emies. Nev­er­the­less, Har­ry, while you may on­ly have de­layed his re­turn to pow­er, it will mere­ly take some­one else who is pre­pared to fight what seems a los­ing bat­tle next time — and if he is de­layed again, and again, why, he may nev­er re­turn to pow­er.”

Har­ry nod­ded, but stopped quick­ly, be­cause it made his head hurt. Then he said, “Sir, there are some oth­er things I’d like to know, if you can tell me…things I want to know the truth about.…”

“The truth.” Dum­ble­dore sighed. “It is a beau­ti­ful and ter­ri­ble thing, and should there­fore be treat­ed with great cau­tion. How­ev­er, I shall an­swer your ques­tions un­less I have a very good rea­son not to, in which case I beg you’ll for­give me. I shall not, of course, lie.”

“Well…Volde­mort said that he on­ly killed my moth­er be­cause she tried to stop him from killing me. But why would he want to kill me in the first place?”

Dum­ble­dore sighed very deeply this time.

“Alas, the first thing you ask me, I can­not tell you. Not to­day. Not now. You will know, one day…put it from your mind for now, Har­ry. When you are old­er…I know you hate to hear this…when you are ready, you will know.”

And Har­ry knew it would be no good to ar­gue.

“But why couldn’t Quir­rell touch me?”

“Your moth­er died to save you. If there is one thing Volde­mort can­not un­der­stand, it is love. He didn’t re­al­ize that love as pow­er­ful as your moth­er’s for you leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no vis­ible sign…to have been loved so deeply, even though the per­son who loved us is gone, will give us some pro­tec­tion for­ev­er. It is in your very skin. Quir­rell, full of ha­tred, greed, and am­bi­tion, shar­ing his soul with Volde­mort, could not touch you for this rea­son. It was agony to touch a per­son marked by some­thing so good.”

Dum­ble­dore now be­came very in­ter­est­ed in a bird out on the win­dowsill, which gave Har­ry time to dry his eyes on the sheet. When he had found his voice again, Har­ry said, “And the in­vis­ibil­ity cloak — do you know who sent it to me?”

“Ah — your fa­ther hap­pened to leave it in my pos­ses­sion, and I thought you might like it.” Dum­ble­dore’s eyes twin­kled. “Use­ful things…your fa­ther used it main­ly for sneak­ing off to the kitchens to steal food when he was here.”

“And there’s some­thing else…”

“Fire away.”

“Quir­rell said Snape —”

“Pro­fes­sor Snape, Har­ry.”

“Yes, him — Quir­rell said he hates me be­cause he hat­ed my fa­ther. Is that true?”

“Well, they did rather de­test each oth­er. Not un­like your­self and Mr. Mal­foy. And then, your fa­ther did some­thing Snape could nev­er for­give.”

“What?”

“He saved his life.”

“What?”

“Yes…” said Dum­ble­dore dream­ily. “Fun­ny, the way peo­ple’s minds work, isn’t it? Pro­fes­sor Snape couldn’t bear be­ing in your fa­ther’s debt…I do be­lieve he worked so hard to pro­tect you this year be­cause he felt that would make him and your fa­ther even. Then he could go back to hat­ing your fa­ther’s mem­ory in peace.…”

Har­ry tried to un­der­stand this but it made his head pound, so he stopped.

“And sir, there’s one more thing…”

“Just the one?”

“How did I get the Stone out of the mir­ror?”

“Ah, now, I’m glad you asked me that. It was one of my more bril­liant ideas, and be­tween you and me, that’s say­ing some­thing. You see, on­ly one who want­ed to find the Stone — find it, but not use it — would be able to get it, oth­er­wise they’d just see them­selves mak­ing gold or drink­ing Elixir of Life. My brain sur­pris­es even me some­times…Now, enough ques­tions. I sug­gest you make a start on these sweets. Ah! Bet­tie Bott’s Ev­ery Fla­vor Beans! I was un­for­tu­nate enough in my youth to come across a vom­it fla­vored one, and since then I’m afraid I’ve rather lost my lik­ing for them — but I think I’ll be safe with a nice tof­fee, don’t you?”

He smiled and popped the gold­en-​brown bean in­to his mouth. Then he choked and said, “Alas! Ear wax!”



Madam Pom­frey, the nurse, was a nice wom­an, but very strict.

“Just five min­utes,” Har­ry plead­ed.

“Ab­so­lute­ly not.”

“You let Pro­fes­sor Dum­ble­dore in….”

“Well, of course, that was the head­mas­ter, quite dif­fer­ent. You need rest.”

“I am rest­ing, look, ly­ing down and ev­ery­thing. Oh, go on, Madam Pom­frey…”

“Oh, very well,” she said. “But five min­utes on­ly.”

And she let Ron and Hermione in.

“Har­ry!”

Hermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again, but Har­ry was glad she held her­self in as his head was still very sore.

“Oh, Har­ry, we were sure you were go­ing to — Dum­ble­dore was so wor­ried —”

“The whole school’s talk­ing about it,” said Ron. “What re­al­ly hap­pened?”

It was one of those rare oc­ca­sions when the true sto­ry is even more strange and ex­cit­ing than the wild ru­mors. Har­ry told them ev­ery­thing: Quir­rell; the mir­ror; the Stone; and Volde­mort. Ron and Hermione were a very good au­di­ence; they gasped in all the right places, and when Har­ry told them what was un­der Quir­rell’s tur­ban, Hermione screamed out loud.

“So the Stone’s gone?” said Ron fi­nal­ly. “Flamel’s just go­ing to die?”

“That’s what I said, but Dum­ble­dore thinks that — what was it? — ‘to the well-​or­ga­nized mind, death is but the next great ad­ven­ture.’”

“I al­ways said he was off his rock­er,” said Ron, look­ing quite im­pressed at how crazy his hero was.

“So what hap­pened to you two?” said Har­ry.

“Well, I got back all right,” said Hermione. “I brought Ron round — that took a while — and we were dash­ing up to the owlery to con­tact Dum­ble­dore when we met him in the en­trance hall — he al­ready knew — he just said, ‘Har­ry’s gone af­ter him, hasn’t he?’ and hur­tled off to the third floor.”

“D’you think he meant you to do it?” said Ron. “Send­ing you your fa­ther’s cloak and ev­ery­thing?”

“Well, ” Hermione ex­plod­ed, “if he did — I mean to say that’s ter­ri­ble — you could have been killed.”

“No, it isn’t,” said Har­ry thought­ful­ly. “He’s a fun­ny man, Dum­ble­dore. I think he sort of want­ed to give me a chance. I think he knows more or less ev­ery­thing that goes on here, you know. I reck­on he had a pret­ty good idea we were go­ing to try, and in­stead of stop­ping us, he just taught us enough to help. I don’t think it was an ac­ci­dent he let me find out how the mir­ror worked. It’s al­most like he thought I had the right to face Volde­mort if I could….”

“Yeah, Dum­ble­dore’s off his rock­er, all right,” said Ron proud­ly. “Lis­ten, you’ve got to be up for the end-​of-​year feast to­mor­row. The points are all in and Slytherin won, of course — you missed the last Quid­ditch match, we were steam­rollered by Raven­claw with­out you — but the food’ll be good.”

At that mo­ment, Madam Pom­frey bus­tled over.

“You’ve had near­ly fif­teen min­utes, now OUT” she said firm­ly.



Af­ter a good night’s sleep, Har­ry felt near­ly back to nor­mal.

I want to go to the feast,” he told Madam Pom­frey as she straight­ened his many can­dy box­es. I can, can’t I?”

“Pro­fes­sor Dum­ble­dore says you are to be al­lowed to go,” she said stiffly, as though in her opin­ion Pro­fes­sor Dum­ble­dore didn’t re­al­ize how risky feasts could be. “And you have an­oth­er vis­itor.”

“Oh, good,” said Har­ry. “Who is it?”

Ha­grid si­dled through the door as he spoke. As usu­al when he was in­doors, Ha­grid looked too big to be al­lowed. He sat down next to Har­ry, took one look at him, and burst in­to tears.

“It’s — all — my — rud­dy — fault!” he sobbed, his face in his hands. I told the evil git how ter get past Fluffy! I told him! It was the on­ly thing he didn’t know, an’ I told him! Yeh could’ve died! All fer a drag­on egg! I’ll nev­er drink again! I should be chucked out an’ made ter live as a Mug­gle!”

“Ha­grid!” said Har­ry, shocked to see Ha­grid shak­ing with grief and re­morse, great tears leak­ing down in­to his beard. “Ha­grid, he’d have found out some­how, this is Volde­mort we’re talk­ing about, he’d have found out even if you hadn’t told him.”

“Yeh could’ve died!” sobbed Ha­grid. “An’ don’ say the name!”

“VOLDE­MORT!” Har­ry bel­lowed, and Ha­grid was so shocked, he stopped cry­ing. “I’ve met him and I’m call­ing him by his name. Please cheer up, Ha­grid, we saved the Stone, it’s gone, he can’t use it. Have a Choco­late Frog, I’ve got loads.…”

Ha­grid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and said, “That re­minds me. I’ve got yeh a present.”

“It’s not a stoat sand­wich, is it?” said Har­ry anx­ious­ly, and at last Ha­grid gave a weak chuck­le.

“Nah. Dum­ble­dore gave me the day off yes­ter­day ter fix it. ‘course, he shoul­da sacked me in­stead — any­way, got yeh this.…”

It seemed to be a hand­some, leather-​cov­ered book. Har­ry opened it cu­ri­ous­ly. It was full of wiz­ard pho­tographs. Smil­ing and wav­ing at him from ev­ery page were his moth­er and fa­ther.

“Sent owls off ter all yer par­ents’ old school friends, askin’ fer pho­tos…knew yeh didn’ have any…d’yeh like it?”

Har­ry couldn’t speak, but Ha­grid un­der­stood.



Har­ry made his way down to the end-​of-​year feast alone that night. He had been held up by Madam Pom­frey’s fuss­ing about, in­sist­ing on giv­ing him one last check­up, so the Great Hall was al­ready full. It was decked out in the Slytherin col­ors of green and sil­ver to cel­ebrate Slytherin’s win­ning the house cup for the sev­enth year in a row. A huge ban­ner show­ing the Slytherin ser­pent cov­ered the wall be­hind the High Ta­ble.

When Har­ry walked in there was a sud­den hush, and then ev­ery­body start­ed talk­ing loud­ly at once. He slipped in­to a seat be­tween Ron and Hermione at the Gryffind­or ta­ble and tried to ig­nore the fact that peo­ple were stand­ing up to look at him.

For­tu­nate­ly, Dum­ble­dore ar­rived mo­ments lat­er. The bab­ble died away.

“An­oth­er year gone!” Dum­ble­dore said cheer­ful­ly. “And I must trou­ble you with an old man’s wheez­ing waf­fle be­fore we sink our teeth in­to our de­li­cious feast. What a year it has been! Hope­ful­ly your heads are all a lit­tle fuller than they were…you have the whole sum­mer ahead to get them nice and emp­ty be­fore next year starts.…

“Now, as I un­der­stand it, the house cup here needs award­ing, and the points stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffind­or, with three hun­dred and twelve points; in third, Huf­flepuff, with three hun­dred and fifty-​two; Raven­claw has four hun­dred and twen­ty-​six and Slytherin, four hun­dred and sev­en­ty-​two.”

A storm of cheer­ing and stamp­ing broke out from the Slytherin ta­ble. Har­ry could see Dra­co Mal­foy bang­ing his gob­let on the ta­ble. It was a sick­en­ing sight.

“Yes, Yes, well done, Slytherin,” said Dum­ble­dore. “How­ev­er, re­cent events must be tak­en in­to ac­count.”

The room went very still. The Slytherins’ smiles fad­ed a lit­tle.

“Ahem,” said Dum­ble­dore. “I have a few last-​minute points to dish out. Let me see. Yes…

“First — to Mr. Ronald Weasley…”

Ron went pur­ple in the face; he looked like a radish with a bad sun­burn.

“…for the best-​played game of chess Hog­warts has seen in many years, I award Gryffind­or house fifty points.”

Gryffind­or cheers near­ly raised the be­witched ceil­ing; the stars over­head seemed to quiver. Per­cy could be heard telling the oth­er pre­fects, “My broth­er, you know! My youngest broth­er! Got past McG­ona­gall’s gi­ant chess set!”

At last there was si­lence again.

“Sec­ond — to Miss Hermione Granger…for the use of cool log­ic in the face of fire, I award Gryffind­or house fifty points.”

Hermione buried her face in her arms; Har­ry strong­ly sus­pect­ed she had burst in­to tears. Gryffind­ors up and down the ta­ble were be­side them­selves — they were a hun­dred points up.

“Third — to Mr. Har­ry Pot­ter…” said Dum­ble­dore. The room went dead­ly qui­et. “…for pure nerve and out­stand­ing courage, I award Gryffind­or house six­ty points.”

The din was deaf­en­ing. Those who could add up while yelling them­selves hoarse knew that Gryffind­or now had four hun­dred and sev­en­ty-​two points — ex­act­ly the same as Slytherin. They had tied for the house cup — if on­ly Dum­ble­dore had giv­en Har­ry just one more point.

Dum­ble­dore raised his hand. The room grad­ual­ly fell silent.

“There are all kinds of courage,” said Dum­ble­dore, smil­ing. “It takes a great deal of brav­ery to stand up to our en­emies, but just as much to stand up to our friends. I there­fore award ten points to Mr. Neville Long­bot­tom.”

Some­one stand­ing out­side the Great Hall might well have thought some sort of ex­plo­sion had tak­en place, so loud was the noise that erupt­ed from the Gryffind­or ta­ble. Har­ry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock, dis­ap­peared un­der a pile of peo­ple hug­ging him. He had nev­er won so much as a point for Gryffind­or be­fore. Har­ry, still cheer­ing, nudged Ron in the ribs and point­ed at Mal­foy, who couldn’t have looked more stunned and hor­ri­fied if he’d just had the Body-​Bind Curse put on him.

“Which means,” Dum­ble­dore called over the storm of ap­plause, for even Raven­claw and Huf­flepuff were cel­ebrat­ing the down­fall of Slytherin, “we need a lit­tle change of dec­ora­tion.”

He clapped his hands. In an in­stant, the green hang­ings be­came scar­let and the sil­ver be­came gold; the huge Slytherin ser­pent van­ished and a tow­er­ing Gryffind­or li­on took its place. Snape was shak­ing Pro­fes­sor McG­ona­gall’s hand, with a hor­ri­ble, forced smile. He caught Har­ry’s eye and Har­ry knew at once that Snape’s feel­ings to­ward him hadn’t changed one jot. This didn’t wor­ry Har­ry. It seemed as though life would be back to nor­mal next year, or as nor­mal as it ev­er was at Hog­warts.

It was the best evening of Har­ry’s life, bet­ter than win­ning at Quid­ditch, or Christ­mas, or knock­ing out moun­tain trolls…he would nev­er, ev­er for­get tonight.



Har­ry had al­most for­got­ten that the ex­am re­sults were still to come, but come they did. To their great sur­prise, both he and Ron passed with good marks; Hermione, of course, had the best grades of the first years. Even Neville scraped through, his good Her­bol­ogy mark mak­ing up for his abysmal Po­tions one. They had hoped that Goyle, who was al­most as stupid as he was mean, might be thrown out, but he had passed, too. It was a shame, but as Ron said, you couldn’t have ev­ery­thing in life.

And sud­den­ly, their wardrobes were emp­ty, their trunks were packed, Neville’s toad was found lurk­ing in a cor­ner of the toi­lets; notes were hand­ed out to all stu­dents, warn­ing them not to use mag­ic over the hol­idays (“I al­ways hope they’ll for­get to give us these,” said Fred Weasley sad­ly); Ha­grid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake; they were board­ing the Hog­warts Ex­press; talk­ing and laugh­ing as the coun­try­side be­came green­er and ti­di­er; eat­ing Bet­tie Bott’s Ev­ery Fla­vor Beans as they sped past Mug­gle towns; pulling off their wiz­ard robes and putting on jack­ets and coats; pulling in­to plat­form nine and three-​quar­ters at King’s Cross Sta­tion.

It took quite a while for them all to get off the plat­form. A wiz­ened old guard was up by the tick­et bar­ri­er, let­ting them go through the gate in twos and threes so they didn’t at­tract at­ten­tion by all burst­ing out of a sol­id wall at once and alarm­ing the Mug­gles.

“You must come and stay this sum­mer,” said Ron, “both of you — I’ll send you an owl.”

“Thanks,” said Har­ry, “I’ll need some­thing to look for­ward to.” Peo­ple jos­tled them as they moved for­ward to­ward the gate­way back to the Mug­gle world. Some of them called:

“Bye, Har­ry!”

“See you, Pot­ter!”

“Still fa­mous,” said Ron, grin­ning at him.

“Not where I’m go­ing, I promise you,” said Har­ry.

He, Ron, and Hermione passed through the gate­way to­geth­er. “There he is, Mom, there he is, look!”

It was Gin­ny Weasley, Ron’s younger sis­ter, but she wasn’t point­ing at Ron.

“Har­ry Pot­ter!” she squealed. “Look, Mom! I can see —”

“Be qui­et, Gin­ny, and it’s rude to point.”

Mrs. Weasley smiled down at them.

“Busy year?” she said.

“Very,” said Har­ry. “Thanks for the fudge and the sweater, Mrs. Weasley.”

“Oh, it was noth­ing, dear.”

“Ready, are you?”

It was Un­cle Ver­non, still pur­ple-​faced, still mus­tached, still look­ing fu­ri­ous at the nerve of Har­ry, car­ry­ing an owl in a cage in a sta­tion full of or­di­nary peo­ple. Be­hind him stood Aunt Petu­nia and Dud­ley, look­ing ter­ri­fied at the very sight of Har­ry.

“You must be Har­ry’s fam­ily!” said Mrs. Weasley.

“In a man­ner of speak­ing,” said Un­cle Ver­non. “Hur­ry up, boy, we haven’t got all day.” He walked away.

Har­ry hung back for a last word with Ron and Hermione.

“See you over the sum­mer, then.”

“Hope you have — er — a good hol­iday,” said Hermione, look­ing un­cer­tain­ly af­ter Un­cle Ver­non, shocked that any­one could be so un­pleas­ant.

“Oh, I will,” said Har­ry, and they were sur­prised at the grin that was spread­ing over his face. “They don’t know we’re not al­lowed to use mag­ic at home. I’m go­ing to have a lot of fun with Dud­ley this sum­mer.…
